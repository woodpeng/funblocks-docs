# Mastering Complexity with Holistic Thinking: A Comprehensive Guide

## 1. Introduction: Seeing the Forest for the Trees

Imagine you're assembling a complex jigsaw puzzle. You could focus on individual pieces, meticulously fitting them together based on color or shape. But to truly solve it efficiently, you step back, look at the picture on the box – the *whole* image. This is the essence of **Holistic Thinking**, a powerful mental model that emphasizes understanding the interconnectedness and interdependence of elements within a system, rather than just focusing on individual parts in isolation.

In our increasingly complex world, bombarded with information and facing multifaceted challenges, Holistic Thinking is no longer just a beneficial approach – it's becoming essential. From navigating intricate business landscapes to understanding global issues like climate change, the ability to see the bigger picture, to recognize how different aspects influence each other, is crucial for effective decision-making and problem-solving.  We are constantly interacting with systems – our bodies, our communities, our economies, and the environment.  Holistic Thinking provides us with a framework to analyze and interact with these systems more effectively.  It's about moving beyond linear, cause-and-effect thinking to embrace the dynamic interplay of forces that shape our reality.

**Holistic Thinking**, in its simplest definition, is a mental model that encourages us to understand a subject or problem by considering it as a whole system with interconnected parts, rather than as a collection of isolated components. It's about recognizing that the whole is often greater than the sum of its parts, and that understanding the relationships between these parts is just as important as understanding the parts themselves.  This approach allows for deeper insights, more creative solutions, and a more nuanced understanding of the world around us.  It's a shift in perspective, from reductionist analysis to integrative synthesis, enabling us to navigate complexity and make more informed, impactful decisions.

## 2. Historical Background: Roots in Ancient Wisdom and Systems Science

The concept of Holistic Thinking isn't a modern invention; its roots stretch back centuries to ancient philosophical and spiritual traditions.  Eastern philosophies, particularly **Taoism** and **Buddhism**, have long emphasized the interconnectedness of all things.  Taoism, for instance, with its principle of Yin and Yang, highlights the complementary and interdependent nature of seemingly opposing forces, urging us to see the universe as a unified whole.  Similarly, Buddhist philosophy emphasizes interdependence (dependent origination), suggesting that nothing exists in isolation and that all phenomena arise in relation to each other. These ancient perspectives laid the groundwork for understanding the world as a web of relationships rather than a collection of separate entities.

In Western thought, while reductionism – breaking down complex phenomena into smaller parts for analysis – has been a dominant approach, holistic ideas have also emerged throughout history.  Thinkers like **Aristotle**, though often associated with logic and categorization, also recognized the importance of considering the *telos* or purpose of a whole system, suggesting a holistic view in understanding natural phenomena.  Later, during the Romantic era, philosophers and artists reacted against the purely mechanistic worldview of the Enlightenment, emphasizing the importance of intuition, feeling, and the interconnectedness of nature, reflecting a nascent form of holistic thinking.

However, the formal articulation of Holistic Thinking as a mental model, particularly within scientific and systematic frameworks, gained momentum in the 20th century with the rise of **systems theory**.  **Ludwig von Bertalanffy**, an Austrian biologist, is considered a key figure in the development of systems theory. In the mid-20th century, he challenged the prevailing reductionist approach in biology and other sciences, arguing that living organisms and other complex systems should be studied as wholes, with attention to the relationships and interactions between their parts.  His work, particularly his book "General System Theory" (1968), laid the foundation for understanding systems as integrated entities exhibiting emergent properties – properties that arise from the interactions of the components and are not present in the components themselves in isolation.

Von Bertalanffy's work was influenced by earlier thinkers like **Jan Smuts**, who coined the term "holism" in his 1926 book "Holism and Evolution." Smuts, a South African statesman and philosopher, argued for holism as a fundamental principle of nature, suggesting that evolution progresses through the formation of wholes, from atoms to cells to organisms to societies.  Smuts emphasized the "synthetic" nature of holism, seeing it as a creative force that integrates parts into increasingly complex and unified wholes.

Over time, systems thinking and holistic approaches have evolved and expanded across various disciplines, including ecology, management, cybernetics, and social sciences.  The work of thinkers like **Jay Forrester** in system dynamics, **Peter Senge** in organizational learning, and **Fritjof Capra** in ecological thinking further popularized and refined holistic perspectives.  Today, Holistic Thinking is recognized as a valuable framework for tackling complex problems in diverse fields, from environmental sustainability to business innovation to personal well-being.  It represents a synthesis of ancient wisdom and modern scientific understanding, providing a powerful lens for navigating the complexities of the 21st century.

## 3. Core Concepts Analysis: Unpacking the Principles of Holistic Thinking

Holistic Thinking, while seemingly intuitive, is built upon several core concepts that provide a structured approach to understanding complex systems. Let's delve into these key principles:

*   **Interconnectedness:** This is the cornerstone of Holistic Thinking. It recognizes that everything is connected to everything else, albeit to varying degrees. No element exists in complete isolation. Changes in one part of a system will inevitably ripple through and affect other parts, directly or indirectly.  Think of a spider web – pulling on one strand vibrates the entire structure. In a business context, a change in marketing strategy will affect sales, operations, and even company culture.  In an ecosystem, the decline of a predator population can lead to an overpopulation of its prey, impacting plant life and the entire food web.  Recognizing interconnectedness means looking beyond isolated events to see the web of relationships that link them.

*   **Context Matters:** Holistic Thinking emphasizes the importance of context. Understanding any element or event requires considering the environment in which it exists.  Meaning and significance are derived from context.  A single data point is meaningless without understanding the dataset it belongs to.  A business decision that is brilliant in one market might be disastrous in another due to different cultural, economic, or regulatory contexts.  Similarly, a symptom in a patient needs to be understood within the context of their medical history, lifestyle, and environment to make an accurate diagnosis.  Context provides the frame of reference necessary for interpretation and understanding.

*   **Systems Perspective:** Holistic Thinking inherently adopts a systems perspective. It views the subject of analysis as a system, which is a set of interacting or interdependent components forming a complex whole.  Systems can be physical (like a human body or a car), biological (an ecosystem), social (a community or an organization), or conceptual (a business process or a supply chain).  A systems perspective focuses on the relationships and interactions *between* components as much as on the components themselves.  It encourages us to see patterns, flows, and structures within the system.  Understanding a car holistically means not just knowing about the engine, wheels, and chassis, but also how these parts interact to enable transportation.  Understanding a business as a system involves analyzing how marketing, sales, production, and customer service departments interact to achieve organizational goals.

*   **Emergence:** This is a crucial concept in systems thinking and Holistic Thinking. Emergence refers to the phenomenon where the whole system exhibits properties that are not present in its individual parts.  These "emergent properties" arise from the interactions and relationships between the components.  Consider a flock of birds. Individual birds follow simple rules, but collectively they exhibit complex flocking behavior – forming intricate patterns in the sky that are not programmed into any single bird.  Consciousness is often cited as an emergent property of the brain – individual neurons don't possess consciousness, but their complex interactions give rise to it. In organizations, company culture is an emergent property arising from the interactions of employees, policies, and values.  Holistic Thinking seeks to understand these emergent properties and how they shape the system's behavior.

*   **Feedback Loops:** Systems are dynamic and often self-regulating through feedback loops.  A feedback loop is a process where the output of a system is fed back as input, influencing future behavior.  **Positive feedback loops** amplify change, creating a reinforcing cycle (like compound interest or viral marketing).  **Negative feedback loops** dampen change, maintaining stability and equilibrium (like a thermostat regulating temperature or the body regulating blood sugar). Understanding feedback loops is crucial for predicting system behavior and intervening effectively.  For example, in climate change, melting ice caps create a positive feedback loop – less ice means less reflection of sunlight, leading to further warming and more ice melt.  In business, customer reviews can create a feedback loop – positive reviews attract more customers, leading to more positive reviews (or vice versa for negative reviews).

**Examples Illustrating Holistic Thinking in Action:**

1.  **Healthcare - Patient Diagnosis:** A doctor using Holistic Thinking would not just focus on the patient's presenting symptoms in isolation.  Instead, they would consider the patient's entire medical history, lifestyle, diet, stress levels, social environment, and even their emotional state.  They would recognize that a headache, for example, could be a symptom of dehydration, stress, eye strain, or a more serious underlying condition.  By considering the patient as a whole system, the doctor can make a more accurate diagnosis and develop a more effective, personalized treatment plan that addresses the root causes rather than just masking symptoms.  This holistic approach to healthcare emphasizes preventative care and overall well-being, not just treating illness in isolation.

2.  **Business Strategy - Market Entry:**  A company considering entering a new market using Holistic Thinking wouldn't just analyze market size and potential profit.  They would also consider the cultural context, the political and regulatory landscape, the existing competitive environment, the supply chain infrastructure, the availability of skilled labor, and the potential impact on their brand reputation.  They would recognize that these factors are interconnected and can influence each other.  For example, a seemingly attractive market might be unsuitable due to complex regulations or strong local competitors.  A holistic market entry strategy would involve a comprehensive assessment of all these interconnected factors to make a well-informed and sustainable decision, minimizing risks and maximizing long-term success.

3.  **Environmental Conservation - Ecosystem Management:**  When addressing environmental issues like deforestation, a holistic approach is crucial.  Simply planting trees without considering the wider ecosystem can be ineffective or even harmful.  Holistic Thinking in conservation would involve understanding the entire ecosystem – the soil quality, water cycles, biodiversity, climate patterns, and the role of different species.  It would also consider the social and economic factors that contribute to deforestation, such as poverty, land tenure issues, and unsustainable agricultural practices.  A holistic conservation strategy might involve community engagement, sustainable forestry practices, habitat restoration, and policies that address the root causes of environmental degradation.  It recognizes that environmental problems are complex and require integrated solutions that consider the interconnectedness of ecological, social, and economic systems.

These examples demonstrate how Holistic Thinking provides a framework for understanding complex situations by considering interconnectedness, context, systems perspectives, emergence, and feedback loops.  It's a shift from reductionist analysis to a more integrative and comprehensive approach, leading to deeper insights and more effective solutions.

## 4. Practical Applications: Holistic Thinking Across Domains

The power of Holistic Thinking lies in its broad applicability across diverse domains.  Its principles can be applied to enhance understanding and decision-making in virtually any field dealing with complexity.  Here are five specific application cases:

1.  **Business Strategy and Innovation:** In the business world, Holistic Thinking is invaluable for developing robust strategies and fostering innovation.  Instead of focusing solely on quarterly profits or individual product lines, a holistic approach encourages businesses to consider the entire organizational ecosystem – customers, employees, suppliers, competitors, the broader market, and the socio-economic environment.  For example, when developing a new product, Holistic Thinking prompts companies to consider not just its features and functionality, but also its environmental impact, ethical sourcing of materials, its effect on employee workload, and its alignment with the company's overall mission and values.  This comprehensive perspective can lead to more sustainable and impactful innovations that resonate with stakeholders and create long-term value.  Holistic Thinking also helps in understanding market trends and disruptions by recognizing the interplay of various factors, allowing businesses to anticipate changes and adapt proactively.

2.  **Personal Development and Well-being:** Applying Holistic Thinking to personal life can lead to greater self-awareness, improved well-being, and more effective personal growth.  Instead of focusing on isolated aspects like career success or physical fitness, a holistic approach encourages individuals to consider all dimensions of their life – physical, mental, emotional, social, and spiritual.  For instance, when setting personal goals, Holistic Thinking suggests considering how these goals align with one's values, how they impact relationships, and how they contribute to overall life satisfaction.  It also emphasizes the interconnectedness of different aspects of well-being.  Recognizing that stress at work can impact physical health and emotional well-being, a holistic approach to personal development might involve strategies that address stress management, healthy habits, meaningful relationships, and a sense of purpose, leading to a more balanced and fulfilling life.

3.  **Education and Curriculum Design:** Holistic Thinking can revolutionize education by moving beyond rote memorization and fragmented subjects to foster deeper understanding and interdisciplinary learning.  A holistic educational approach emphasizes connecting different subjects, showing students how knowledge from various disciplines is interconnected and relevant to real-world problems.  For example, instead of teaching history, science, and literature in isolation, a holistic curriculum might explore a theme like "sustainability" by examining its historical roots, scientific principles, and literary representations.  This approach encourages critical thinking, problem-solving, and the ability to see connections across disciplines.  It also emphasizes the development of the whole person – intellectual, emotional, social, and ethical – preparing students to be well-rounded and engaged citizens capable of navigating complex challenges.

4.  **Technology Design and Implementation:**  In the field of technology, Holistic Thinking is crucial for designing user-centered, ethical, and sustainable technologies.  Instead of focusing solely on technical functionality, a holistic approach to technology design considers the broader societal impact, ethical implications, and user experience.  For example, when developing artificial intelligence systems, Holistic Thinking prompts developers to consider potential biases in algorithms, the impact on employment, privacy concerns, and the ethical implications of autonomous decision-making.  It also emphasizes designing technologies that are accessible, inclusive, and contribute to human well-being.  Holistic implementation of technology within organizations also involves considering the impact on workflows, employee training, organizational culture, and overall system integration, ensuring that technology enhances rather than disrupts the human element of the organization.

5.  **Urban Planning and Community Development:**  Creating thriving and sustainable cities and communities requires a holistic approach to urban planning and development.  Instead of focusing solely on infrastructure or economic growth, Holistic Thinking in urban planning considers the complex interplay of social, economic, environmental, and cultural factors.  This involves designing cities that are walkable, green, and accessible to all residents, promoting social equity, environmental sustainability, and economic opportunity.  Holistic urban planning considers the interconnectedness of housing, transportation, public spaces, education, healthcare, and community services.  It also emphasizes community engagement and participatory planning processes, recognizing that cities are living systems shaped by the people who inhabit them.  By considering the city as a whole system, urban planners can create more resilient, livable, and equitable urban environments.

These examples illustrate the versatility of Holistic Thinking across diverse domains.  Whether in business, personal life, education, technology, or urban planning, applying a holistic lens allows for a deeper understanding of complex situations, leading to more effective, sustainable, and ethical solutions.  It is a mental model that empowers us to navigate complexity and create positive change in a multifaceted world.

## 5. Comparison with Related Mental Models: Navigating the Thinking Toolkit

Holistic Thinking is a powerful mental model, but it’s not the only one that helps us deal with complexity. Understanding its relationship to other related models can help us choose the right tool for the task. Let's compare Holistic Thinking with two closely related mental models: [Systems Thinking](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/systems-thinking) and [Reductionism](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/reductionism).

**Holistic Thinking vs. Systems Thinking:**

Systems Thinking and Holistic Thinking are often used interchangeably and are indeed very closely related. In many ways, Holistic Thinking can be considered the overarching philosophy, while Systems Thinking provides a more structured and methodological approach to applying holistic principles.  Both emphasize interconnectedness, context, and seeing the "big picture."  They both focus on understanding systems as wholes rather than just collections of parts.

**Similarities:**

*   **Focus on Interconnections:** Both models prioritize understanding the relationships and interactions between components within a system.
*   **Emphasis on Context:** Both acknowledge the importance of context in understanding any element or event within a system.
*   **"Big Picture" Perspective:** Both encourage stepping back and seeing the overall system rather than getting lost in details.
*   **Understanding Emergence:** Both recognize and seek to understand emergent properties of systems.
*   **Dynamic View:** Both view systems as dynamic and constantly changing, rather than static entities.

**Differences:**

*   **Methodology:** Systems Thinking often involves specific methodologies and tools like system dynamics modeling, causal loop diagrams, and stock and flow analysis.  Holistic Thinking is more of a general mindset and philosophical orientation.
*   **Practical Application:** Systems Thinking is often applied in more technical and analytical contexts, such as engineering, management science, and environmental modeling.  Holistic Thinking has broader applications, encompassing personal development, philosophy, and even artistic endeavors.
*   **Scope:** While Systems Thinking is always focused on "systems," Holistic Thinking can be applied to understand anything "holistically," even concepts or ideas that are not strictly defined as systems.

**When to Choose Which:** If you are dealing with a clearly defined system and need a structured approach for analysis, modeling, and intervention, Systems Thinking with its specific tools and methodologies might be more appropriate.  If you are seeking a broader philosophical perspective, a way of understanding complexity in general, or a mindset for personal growth and creativity, Holistic Thinking provides a more encompassing framework.  In practice, they are often used in conjunction, with Holistic Thinking guiding the overall approach and Systems Thinking providing the analytical tools.

**Holistic Thinking vs. Reductionism:**

Reductionism is essentially the *opposite* of Holistic Thinking. It's a mental model that emphasizes understanding complex phenomena by breaking them down into their simplest components and analyzing these parts in isolation.  Reductionism has been incredibly successful in many areas of science, particularly in physics and chemistry, where understanding fundamental particles and chemical reactions has led to groundbreaking discoveries.

**Similarities (in a limited sense):**

*   **Both are analytical approaches:** Both Reductionism and Holistic Thinking are ways of analyzing and understanding the world.
*   **Both can be valuable:** In certain contexts, both approaches can yield valuable insights and knowledge.

**Differences:**

*   **Focus:** Reductionism focuses on *parts*, while Holistic Thinking focuses on the *whole* and the *relationships* between parts.
*   **Approach:** Reductionism *breaks down* complexity, while Holistic Thinking *embraces* complexity.
*   **Perspective:** Reductionism takes a *narrow*, focused view, while Holistic Thinking takes a *broad*, panoramic view.
*   **Understanding Emergence:** Reductionism typically struggles to explain emergent properties, as it focuses on the properties of individual parts. Holistic Thinking explicitly seeks to understand emergence.
*   **Context:** Reductionism often de-emphasizes context, seeking universal laws and principles. Holistic Thinking emphasizes the crucial role of context.

**When to Choose Which:** Reductionism is highly effective when dealing with systems that are relatively linear, predictable, and where the interactions between parts are minimal or easily understood. It is useful for isolating variables and studying cause-and-effect relationships in controlled environments.  However, Reductionism is less effective when dealing with complex, interconnected, and dynamic systems where emergent properties and feedback loops are significant.  In such cases, Holistic Thinking is far more appropriate.

**Complementary Use:** It's important to note that Reductionism and Holistic Thinking are not mutually exclusive and can even be complementary.  In some situations, a combined approach might be most effective.  For example, in medical research, reductionist approaches are used to study individual genes and molecules, while holistic approaches are used to understand the complex interplay of factors contributing to disease and health.  The key is to recognize the limitations of each model and choose the most appropriate approach, or combination of approaches, based on the specific problem and context.

By understanding the nuances and relationships between Holistic Thinking and other mental models like Systems Thinking and Reductionism, we can become more versatile and effective thinkers, capable of navigating a wider range of complexities and challenges.

## 6. Critical Thinking: Navigating the Limitations and Potential Pitfalls

While Holistic Thinking offers a powerful framework for understanding complexity, it's crucial to approach it with critical thinking and awareness of its limitations and potential drawbacks. Like any mental model, it's not a perfect solution for every situation, and it can be misused or misinterpreted.

**Limitations and Drawbacks:**

*   **Complexity Overload:**  Holistic Thinking, by its very nature, encourages considering a vast array of interconnected factors. This can sometimes lead to "analysis paralysis" – becoming overwhelmed by the sheer number of variables and relationships, making it difficult to take action or make decisions.  It's important to strike a balance between comprehensive understanding and practical action.
*   **Vagueness and Lack of Precision:**  Holistic Thinking can sometimes be perceived as vague or lacking in precision compared to more reductionist or analytical approaches.  The emphasis on interconnectedness and context can make it challenging to define clear boundaries or quantify relationships precisely.  This can be a limitation in situations requiring highly specific and measurable outcomes.
*   **Potential for Oversimplification:** Paradoxically, while Holistic Thinking aims to understand complexity, there's a risk of oversimplifying complex systems by focusing too broadly and superficially.  It's important to avoid generalizations and ensure that the analysis is still rigorous and grounded in evidence, even when considering the bigger picture.
*   **Time and Resource Intensive:**  Conducting a truly holistic analysis can be time-consuming and resource-intensive.  Gathering information on all relevant aspects of a system and understanding their interconnections requires significant effort.  In situations with limited time or resources, a more focused or reductionist approach might be more practical.

**Potential Misuse Cases:**

*   **Justification for Inaction:**  The complexity highlighted by Holistic Thinking can sometimes be used as an excuse for inaction.  Individuals or organizations might feel overwhelmed by the interconnectedness of problems and use this as a reason to avoid taking responsibility or implementing solutions.  It's crucial to remember that understanding complexity should empower action, not paralyze it.
*   **"Everything is Connected" Fallacy:**  While interconnectedness is a core principle, it's important to avoid the fallacy that "everything is equally connected to everything else."  Not all connections are equally significant or relevant.  Holistic Thinking requires discerning relevant connections and prioritizing those that have the most impact on the system or problem being addressed.
*   **Lack of Focus and Prioritization:**  In an attempt to be comprehensive, Holistic Thinking can sometimes lose focus and lack prioritization.  It's important to identify key leverage points and prioritize actions that will have the most significant impact on the system, rather than trying to address every aspect simultaneously.

**Advice to Avoid Misconceptions:**

*   **Balance Breadth with Depth:**  Strive for a balance between understanding the broad context and delving into specific details where necessary.  Holistic Thinking doesn't mean knowing everything about everything, but rather understanding the key relationships and influences that shape the system.
*   **Focus on Relevant Connections:**  Be discerning about the connections you consider.  Not all connections are equally important.  Focus on identifying the most significant relationships that are relevant to the problem or situation at hand.
*   **Use Tools and Frameworks:**  Utilize tools and frameworks from Systems Thinking and other disciplines to structure your holistic analysis and avoid vagueness.  Causal loop diagrams, system maps, and stakeholder analysis can help make the process more concrete and actionable.
*   **Iterate and Adapt:**  Holistic Thinking is an iterative process.  Start with a broad understanding, then refine your analysis as you gather more information and insights.  Be prepared to adapt your understanding and approach as new information emerges.
*   **Action-Oriented Holism:**  Remember that the ultimate goal of Holistic Thinking is often to inform action and decision-making.  Don't get lost in analysis paralysis.  Use your holistic understanding to identify opportunities for intervention and create positive change.

By being aware of these limitations and potential pitfalls, and by applying critical thinking to the process, we can harness the power of Holistic Thinking effectively and avoid common misconceptions. It's about using it as a tool to enhance our understanding and decision-making, not as a dogma or a substitute for rigorous analysis.

## 7. Practical Guide: Implementing Holistic Thinking in Your Life

Ready to start applying Holistic Thinking? Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started, along with a simple thinking exercise:

**Step-by-Step Operational Guide:**

1.  **Define the System or Problem:** Clearly identify the system or problem you want to understand holistically. What are you trying to analyze or solve? Be specific but also consider the broader context. For example, instead of just focusing on "declining sales," define the system as "the company's overall sales and marketing ecosystem."

2.  **Map the System:**  Visualize the system and its components.  Create a system map or diagram.  Identify the key elements, stakeholders, and factors that are part of the system.  Think broadly and include both tangible and intangible elements.  For our sales example, this might include marketing channels, sales team, customer service, product quality, competitor actions, economic conditions, etc.

3.  **Identify Interconnections:** Explore the relationships and interactions between the components you've mapped.  How do these elements influence each other? Draw arrows or lines to show these connections.  Look for feedback loops, both positive and negative.  For example, positive customer reviews might lead to increased sales (positive feedback), while negative reviews might decrease sales (negative feedback).

4.  **Analyze Feedback Loops and Dynamics:**  Delve deeper into the feedback loops you've identified.  How do these loops reinforce or balance each other?  Understand the dynamics of the system over time.  Is it stable, growing, declining, or oscillating?  Consider how changes in one part of the system might ripple through the feedback loops and affect the whole system's behavior.

5.  **Consider the Context:**  Broaden your perspective to consider the wider context in which the system operates.  What are the external factors that influence the system?  These could be social, economic, political, technological, environmental, or cultural factors.  For our sales example, this might include changes in consumer trends, new regulations, technological advancements, or economic downturns.

6.  **Seek Emergent Properties:**  Think about the emergent properties of the system. What are the characteristics or behaviors of the whole system that are not evident in its individual parts?  For example, company culture is an emergent property of the interactions of employees, policies, and values.  Understanding emergent properties can provide valuable insights into the system's overall behavior.

7.  **Iterate and Adapt:** Holistic Thinking is an iterative process.  Your initial understanding is likely to be incomplete.  Continuously refine your system map and analysis as you gather more information and insights.  Be open to revising your understanding and adapting your approach as you learn more about the system.

8.  **Identify Leverage Points:**  Once you have a holistic understanding of the system, identify potential leverage points – areas where small changes can have a significant impact on the system as a whole.  These leverage points are often found in feedback loops or at key points of influence within the system.

9.  **Develop Holistic Solutions:**  Based on your holistic analysis, develop solutions or strategies that address the problem or achieve your goals by considering the system as a whole.  Holistic solutions often involve multiple interventions that address different parts of the system and leverage interconnections.
