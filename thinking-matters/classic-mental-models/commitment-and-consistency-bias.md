# Unlocking the Power of Consistency: Understanding Commitment and Consistency Bias

## 1. Introduction

Imagine you've ever found yourself finishing a terrible movie simply because you'd already invested an hour into it. Or perhaps you've stuck with a project long after realizing it was going nowhere, simply because you publicly announced your dedication to it. These everyday scenarios highlight a powerful mental model at play: **Commitment and Consistency Bias**. This cognitive shortcut, deeply ingrained in human psychology, drives us to align our present actions with our past commitments and behaviors. It’s the silent force pushing us to be consistent, even when it might not be rational or beneficial.

In our increasingly complex world, bombarded with information and choices, understanding mental models like Commitment and Consistency Bias is more crucial than ever. These models are cognitive tools that help us simplify reality, make quicker decisions, and navigate the intricacies of human behavior.  Recognizing this bias allows us to become more aware of its influence on our own decisions and the decisions of others. It empowers us to make more rational choices, resist manipulation, and foster more authentic relationships.  Ignoring this bias, however, can lead to poor choices, missed opportunities, and even exploitation.

So, what exactly is Commitment and Consistency Bias? In its simplest form, it's the tendency to remain consistent with our prior actions, statements, and commitments, even when the original reasons for those commitments are no longer valid or relevant. It's about aligning our self-image and actions to appear consistent, both to ourselves and to others. This deep-seated desire for consistency can be a powerful motivator, but also a significant blind spot in our decision-making process.  Let’s delve deeper into this fascinating mental model and uncover its origins, workings, and practical implications in our daily lives.

## 2. Historical Background: Tracing the Roots of Consistency

The concept of Commitment and Consistency Bias isn't a recent discovery. Its roots can be traced back to the mid-20th century and the burgeoning field of social psychology. While the specific term "Commitment and Consistency Bias" isn't attributed to a single individual as a singular 'discovery', the underlying principles have been explored and articulated by several influential thinkers, most notably **Leon Festinger** and **Robert Cialdini**.

Leon Festinger, a renowned social psychologist, laid crucial groundwork with his theory of **Cognitive Dissonance** in the late 1950s.  Cognitive dissonance describes the mental discomfort we experience when holding conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes. To reduce this discomfort, Festinger argued, we are motivated to change one or more of our cognitions to make them align.  Commitment and Consistency Bias is, in many ways, a manifestation of this drive to reduce dissonance.  When we make a commitment, behaving inconsistently with that commitment creates dissonance.  To resolve this, we often adjust our subsequent actions and beliefs to align with our initial commitment, thus restoring consistency.

While Festinger provided the theoretical underpinning, **Robert Cialdini**, in his seminal 1984 book "Influence: The Psychology of Persuasion," brought the concept to a broader audience and explicitly highlighted "Consistency" as one of the six key principles of persuasion. Cialdini, through extensive research and observation, demonstrated how the desire for consistency is a powerful motivator that can be leveraged in various influence tactics. He popularized techniques like the "foot-in-the-door" technique, which relies directly on Commitment and Consistency Bias. This technique involves getting someone to agree to a small request first, making them more likely to agree to a larger, related request later.  The initial small commitment creates a sense of consistency that individuals are then motivated to uphold.

Over time, the understanding of Commitment and Consistency Bias has evolved and been refined through further research in social psychology, behavioral economics, and marketing.  Researchers have explored the neural basis of consistency, examining how our brains process and value consistent behavior.  The bias has also been studied in diverse cultural contexts, revealing both universal and culturally specific aspects of the desire for consistency.  From its theoretical roots in cognitive dissonance to its practical applications in persuasion and beyond, Commitment and Consistency Bias has become a well-established and widely recognized mental model, offering valuable insights into human behavior and decision-making.  It moved from being a primarily academic concept to a practical tool for understanding and influencing behavior in everyday life.

## 3. Core Concepts Analysis: Deconstructing the Bias

At the heart of Commitment and Consistency Bias lies the fundamental human desire to be seen, and to see ourselves, as consistent individuals. This drive stems from several psychological and social factors. Let's break down the key components and principles of this mental model:

**1. The Power of Commitment:**

Commitment is the cornerstone of this bias. It refers to any action, statement, or promise that publicly or privately binds us to a particular course of action or belief.  Commitments can be active (like signing a contract), passive (like publicly stating an opinion), or even inferred (like accepting a small gift). The more public, voluntary, and effortful the commitment, the stronger its influence becomes.  Think of it like planting a flag on a hill – once planted, it becomes a point of reference for all subsequent actions.

**2. The Drive for Consistency:**

Once a commitment is made, the desire for consistency kicks in. This drive is fueled by several factors:

*   **Cognitive Dissonance Reduction:** As mentioned earlier, inconsistency creates mental discomfort.  Maintaining consistency helps reduce this dissonance and promotes a sense of psychological harmony.
*   **Social Image and Reputation:**  Inconsistency can be perceived as unpredictable, unreliable, or even dishonest. We strive to maintain a consistent public image to be seen as dependable and trustworthy members of society.  Consistency builds trust and social capital.
*   **Heuristics and Mental Shortcuts:** Consistency simplifies decision-making. Once we've made a commitment, sticking to it becomes a mental shortcut, reducing the need to re-evaluate every subsequent related decision from scratch. It's mentally easier to follow a pre-established path than to constantly rethink.
*   **Self-Perception Theory:**  We infer our attitudes and beliefs by observing our own behavior.  When we see ourselves acting consistently with a commitment, we reinforce our self-perception as someone who holds that belief or value, further strengthening the commitment.

**3. Escalation of Commitment:**

This is a particularly potent manifestation of Commitment and Consistency Bias. It describes the tendency to increase commitment to a failing course of action, even when evidence suggests it's a losing proposition.  This happens because abandoning a commitment, especially a public one, can be seen as inconsistent and even as admitting failure.  To avoid this perceived inconsistency and failure, individuals and organizations often double down on their initial commitment, throwing "good money after bad."

**Examples in Action:**

Let's illustrate these concepts with some clear examples:

*   **Example 1: The "Foot-in-the-Door" Sales Technique:** Imagine a salesperson approaches you at your door and asks you to sign a petition supporting a local environmental cause. It’s a small, seemingly harmless request.  Once you sign (making a small commitment), the salesperson then asks if you'd be willing to donate to the same cause.  Because you've already committed to supporting the cause by signing the petition, you're now more likely to donate. You want to be consistent with your initial action. This is the classic "foot-in-the-door" technique exploiting Commitment and Consistency Bias.

*   **Example 2: Gym Membership and Sunk Costs:** You sign up for a year-long gym membership with great intentions.  After a few months, you realize you dislike going to the gym. However, you continue to force yourself to go, even if you dread it. Why? Because you've already paid for the membership (a commitment of money and time).  Even though rationally, it might be better to cut your losses and find an exercise you actually enjoy, the Commitment and Consistency Bias, intertwined with the [Sunk Cost Fallacy](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/sunk-cost-fallacy), pushes you to stick with it to justify your initial commitment and avoid feeling like you wasted your investment.

*   **Example 3:  Online Quizzes and Personality Tests:**  You take an online quiz titled "What Kind of Creative Thinker Are You?"  The quiz results declare you to be an "Innovative Visionary."  Even if you were initially skeptical, you might start to subtly adjust your self-perception to align with this label.  You might begin to seek out opportunities to express your "innovative visionary" side, and even defend the quiz’s accuracy if challenged.  The seemingly trivial act of taking a quiz and receiving a label can create a commitment to that identity, driving consistent behavior and self-belief.

These examples demonstrate how Commitment and Consistency Bias operates in diverse contexts, from sales tactics to personal decisions. Understanding these core concepts is the first step towards recognizing and mitigating the influence of this powerful mental model in our own lives.

## 4. Practical Applications: Consistency in the Real World

Commitment and Consistency Bias isn't just a theoretical concept confined to psychology textbooks. It's a pervasive force shaping our decisions and behaviors in numerous real-world domains. Let's explore some practical applications across different areas:

**1. Business and Marketing:**

*   **Loyalty Programs:**  Businesses leverage Commitment and Consistency Bias through loyalty programs.  By rewarding repeat purchases and creating a sense of "membership," these programs encourage customers to remain consistent with their brand choice.  Points, tiers, and exclusive benefits reinforce the commitment and make switching to a competitor feel inconsistent with their established loyalty.
*   **Subscription Models:**  Subscription services thrive on commitment.  Once a customer subscribes, inertia and the desire to be consistent with their initial decision often keep them subscribed, even if their usage declines.  Free trials that automatically convert to paid subscriptions exploit this bias, hoping the initial "commitment" of signing up will lead to continued subscription.
*   **Content Marketing and Branding:**  Companies build consistent brand messaging and content to establish a clear identity and value proposition.  This consistency helps customers form a stable perception of the brand, fostering trust and loyalty.  Inconsistent messaging, on the other hand, can create confusion and erode customer confidence.
*   **Internal Company Culture:**  Businesses strive to build a consistent internal culture and values.  When employees are consistently exposed to and rewarded for behaviors aligned with company values, it reinforces their commitment to the organization and promotes consistent performance.

**2. Personal Life and Relationships:**

*   **Building Habits:**  Commitment and Consistency Bias can be a powerful tool for habit formation.  By making a small initial commitment to a new habit (e.g., exercising for 10 minutes a day), and consistently sticking to it, we reinforce our self-image as someone who values exercise. This consistency makes it easier to gradually increase the commitment and solidify the habit.
*   **Relationship Dynamics:**  Commitment plays a crucial role in relationships.  Public commitments like marriage vows or even simply introducing someone as "my partner" strengthen the bond and create a sense of obligation to maintain consistency in the relationship.  However, this bias can also trap individuals in unhealthy relationships if they feel overly committed despite growing unhappiness.
*   **Personal Finance:**  Setting financial goals and making public commitments to saving or investing can increase adherence.  Sharing your financial goals with a friend or family member creates a social accountability that leverages the desire for consistency.

**3. Education and Learning:**

*   **Study Habits:** Encouraging students to make small, consistent study commitments (e.g., studying for 30 minutes every day) can be more effective than sporadic, large study sessions.  Consistency builds momentum and reinforces a student's self-perception as a diligent learner.
*   **Skill Development:**  Learning any new skill requires consistent practice.  Breaking down complex skills into smaller, manageable commitments and celebrating consistent progress can help overcome initial discouragement and build long-term proficiency.
*   **Classroom Management:**  Establishing clear classroom rules and consistently enforcing them creates a predictable and consistent learning environment. This consistency helps students understand expectations and promotes consistent behavior.

**4. Technology and Gamification:**

*   **Gamified Apps:**  Many apps utilize gamification techniques that leverage Commitment and Consistency Bias.  Daily streaks, badges for consistent usage, and progress bars create a sense of accomplishment and encourage users to maintain consistent engagement to avoid breaking their streak or losing their progress.
*   **Social Media Engagement:**  Social media platforms are designed to encourage consistent engagement.  Notifications, personalized feeds, and social validation loops create a sense of obligation to check in regularly and maintain consistent online presence.

**5. Negotiation and Persuasion:**

*   **Anchoring Bias and Initial Offers:**  In negotiations, making an initial offer acts as an anchor and a commitment point.  The other party often feels compelled to respond in a consistent range, influenced by the initial anchor.
*   **Small Concessions:**  Gaining small concessions early in a negotiation can create a sense of momentum and commitment to the negotiation process itself, making it more likely for the other party to make further concessions to maintain consistency with their initial cooperative behavior.

These diverse examples highlight the pervasive influence of Commitment and Consistency Bias across various facets of life. Recognizing these applications empowers us to both leverage this bias for positive outcomes (like habit formation or customer loyalty) and to be wary of its potential downsides (like escalating commitment to failing projects or manipulative marketing tactics).

## 5. Comparison with Related Mental Models

Commitment and Consistency Bias, while powerful on its own, is often intertwined with and sometimes confused with other related mental models. Understanding the nuances and distinctions between these models is crucial for effective thinking. Let's compare it with a few closely related concepts:

**1. [Cognitive Dissonance](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/cognitive-dissonance): The Underlying Discomfort**

Cognitive Dissonance, as discussed earlier, is the psychological discomfort arising from holding conflicting beliefs, values, or attitudes. Commitment and Consistency Bias is, in many ways, a *strategy* to reduce cognitive dissonance. When we make a commitment, acting inconsistently creates dissonance.  The drive for consistency is the mechanism we employ to alleviate this discomfort.

*   **Relationship:** Cognitive Dissonance is the broader theory explaining the *why* behind the drive for consistency. Commitment and Consistency Bias is a specific *manifestation* of this drive in action, particularly in the context of prior commitments.
*   **Similarity:** Both models highlight the human motivation to maintain psychological harmony and avoid internal conflict.
*   **Difference:** Cognitive Dissonance is a more general theory about discomfort from conflicting cognitions, while Commitment and Consistency Bias specifically focuses on the pressure to align actions with prior commitments.
*   **When to Choose:** Use Cognitive Dissonance when analyzing the broader discomfort caused by conflicting ideas or behaviors. Use Commitment and Consistency Bias when specifically examining how prior commitments influence subsequent actions and decisions.

**2. [Sunk Cost Fallacy](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/sunk-cost-fallacy): The Trap of Past Investments**

The Sunk Cost Fallacy is the tendency to continue investing in a failing project or endeavor simply because of the resources (time, money, effort) already invested, even when rational analysis suggests it's better to cut losses. While related, it differs slightly from Commitment and Consistency Bias.

*   **Relationship:** Both models can lead to irrational persistence. Sunk Cost Fallacy focuses on *past investments* as the driver of continued commitment. Commitment and Consistency Bias focuses on *prior statements or actions* as the anchor.
*   **Similarity:** Both can result in escalating commitment and poor decision-making by prioritizing past actions over current realities.
*   **Difference:** Sunk Cost Fallacy is primarily driven by loss aversion and the desire to avoid feeling like past investments were wasted. Commitment and Consistency Bias is driven by the desire to maintain a consistent self-image and avoid appearing inconsistent.
*   **When to Choose:** Use Sunk Cost Fallacy when the primary driver of continued commitment is the fear of wasting past investments. Use Commitment and Consistency Bias when the primary driver is the desire to be consistent with prior statements, actions, or public image, even if investments are also involved.  Often, they work in tandem, especially in situations involving financial or time investments tied to public commitments.

**3. [Confirmation Bias](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/confirmation-bias): Seeking Supporting Evidence**

Confirmation Bias is the tendency to favor information that confirms existing beliefs and to disregard information that contradicts them. It reinforces Commitment and Consistency Bias by making us more likely to seek out and interpret information in a way that supports our prior commitments, further solidifying our consistent behavior.

*   **Relationship:** Confirmation Bias acts as a supporting mechanism for Commitment and Consistency Bias.  Once we make a commitment, Confirmation Bias kicks in, leading us to selectively perceive information that justifies our commitment and reinforces our consistent behavior.
*   **Similarity:** Both biases contribute to rigidity in thinking and can hinder objective evaluation of new information.
*   **Difference:** Confirmation Bias is about selective information processing, while Commitment and Consistency Bias is about behavioral consistency with prior actions.
*   **When to Choose:** Use Confirmation Bias when analyzing how information is filtered and interpreted to support pre-existing beliefs. Use Commitment and Consistency Bias when analyzing how prior commitments shape subsequent actions and decisions.  Confirmation Bias often strengthens Commitment and Consistency Bias by reinforcing the perceived validity of our commitments.

Understanding these distinctions helps us apply the most appropriate mental model to analyze a given situation and make more nuanced and effective decisions.  While these biases are related and often interact, recognizing their individual drivers and mechanisms allows for more targeted strategies to mitigate their negative effects and leverage their potential benefits.

## 6. Critical Thinking: Navigating the Pitfalls of Consistency

While Commitment and Consistency Bias can be a useful mental shortcut and a driver of positive behaviors, it's crucial to approach it with critical thinking. Like any mental model, it has limitations and potential drawbacks. Recognizing these pitfalls is essential to avoid misuse and make more rational decisions.

**Limitations and Drawbacks:**

*   **Irrational Persistence:** The most significant drawback is the potential for irrational persistence.  The bias can trap us in unproductive or even harmful courses of action simply because we feel obligated to maintain consistency with past commitments.  This can lead to escalating commitment to failing projects, staying in unhappy relationships, or stubbornly adhering to outdated beliefs.
*   **Resistance to Change:**  The desire for consistency can make us resistant to new information or changing circumstances.  We may cling to initial commitments even when evidence suggests a change of course is necessary. This rigidity can hinder adaptability and innovation.
*   **Manipulation Vulnerability:**  Understanding Commitment and Consistency Bias can be, and often is, used for manipulation. Persuasion techniques like the "foot-in-the-door" and "bait-and-switch" exploit this bias to gain compliance, sometimes leading individuals to agree to things they wouldn't otherwise consider.
*   **Reduced Flexibility and Creativity:**  Over-reliance on consistency can stifle flexibility and creativity.  Constantly striving for consistency might prevent us from exploring new approaches or considering alternative perspectives that deviate from our established patterns.
*   **Ethical Concerns:**  Exploiting Commitment and Consistency Bias in marketing, sales, or interpersonal interactions can raise ethical concerns.  While persuasion is part of communication, manipulative tactics that prey on this bias can be detrimental and unethical.

**Potential Misuse Cases:**

*   **High-Pressure Sales Tactics:**  Unscrupulous salespeople might use techniques to extract small initial commitments to pressure customers into making larger, unwanted purchases.
*   **Political Propaganda:**  Political campaigns can use subtle tactics to elicit initial public endorsements or statements of support, making individuals more likely to consistently vote or advocate for that candidate even if their views evolve.
*   **Cult Recruitment:**  Cults often use gradual indoctrination techniques, starting with small commitments and gradually escalating demands.  The desire for consistency keeps members trapped in the cult, even as the demands become increasingly extreme.
*   **Gaslighting and Manipulation in Relationships:**  Abusive partners might manipulate their victims by creating a false sense of commitment or obligation, making it harder for victims to recognize and escape the abusive situation.

**Avoiding Common Misconceptions and Mitigating Negative Effects:**

*   **Awareness is Key:** The first step is recognizing that Commitment and Consistency Bias exists and understanding how it operates.  Self-awareness allows us to be more mindful of its influence on our own decisions.
*   **Question Your Commitments:** Regularly evaluate your commitments. Ask yourself *why* you made the commitment in the first place. Are the original reasons still valid? Is the commitment still serving your best interests?
*   **Seek Diverse Perspectives:**  Actively seek out opinions and information that challenge your existing commitments.  Surround yourself with people who offer different viewpoints and are willing to question your assumptions.
*   **Be Willing to Change Course:**  Recognize that changing your mind is not a sign of weakness or inconsistency, but rather a sign of intellectual honesty and adaptability.  It's okay to adjust your commitments when new information or changing circumstances warrant it.
*   **Focus on Principles, Not Just Consistency:**  Prioritize your core values and principles over the need for rigid consistency. True integrity lies in acting in accordance with your values, even if it means adjusting past commitments.
*   **Develop a "Stop-Loss" Mentality:**  In situations involving investments or projects, establish clear "stop-loss" points.  Decide in advance when you will cut your losses and move on, regardless of past commitments.

By critically examining Commitment and Consistency Bias, understanding its limitations, and actively employing strategies to mitigate its negative effects, we can harness its positive aspects while avoiding its potential pitfalls, leading to more rational and effective decision-making.

## 7. Practical Guide: Applying Consistency Consciously

Now that we understand the intricacies of Commitment and Consistency Bias, let's explore a practical step-by-step guide to consciously apply this mental model in your life, both to benefit yourself and to be aware of its influence on you from others.

**Step-by-Step Operational Guide:**

1.  **Identify Your Current Commitments:**  Take some time to reflect on your current commitments in various areas of your life: work, relationships, personal goals, finances, etc.  List them out. These can be formal commitments (contracts, agreements) or informal ones (promises, stated intentions, established habits).

2.  **Analyze the Origins of Your Commitments:** For each commitment, ask yourself: "Why did I make this commitment in the first place?"  Understand the initial reasons, motivations, and circumstances that led to each commitment.  Was it a rational decision? Was it based on accurate information? Were you influenced by external pressures?

3.  **Evaluate the Current Relevance and Value:**  Now, assess the current relevance and value of each commitment.  Are the original reasons still valid?  Has the situation changed?  Is this commitment still aligned with your current goals and values? Is it still serving you well?  Be honest with yourself, even if it's uncomfortable to question long-held commitments.

4.  **Seek External Perspectives:**  Discuss your commitments with trusted friends, mentors, or advisors.  Explain your commitments and your evaluation.  Ask for their honest feedback and alternative perspectives.  Are they seeing any potential downsides or inconsistencies that you might be missing?  External perspectives can help overcome confirmation bias and provide a more objective view.

5.  **Be Prepared to Adjust or Re-Commit (Consciously):** Based on your analysis and external feedback, decide whether to continue with each commitment, adjust it, or even abandon it.  *Consciously* re-commit to the commitments that still align with your goals and values.  Be willing to let go of commitments that are no longer serving you, even if it feels inconsistent with past actions.  Remember, adaptability is a strength, not a weakness.

**Simple Thinking Exercise/Worksheet: "Commitment Audit"**

Create a table with the following columns:

| Commitment Area (e.g., Work Project, Relationship, Habit) | Specific Commitment (e.g., "Lead Project X," "Relationship with Y," "Daily Gym") | Original Reason for Commitment | Current Relevance & Value (High/Medium/Low) | External Perspective Feedback | Action Plan (Continue/Adjust/Abandon) |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |
|  |  |  |  |  |  |

Fill out this table for 3-5 key commitments in your life.  This exercise will help you systematically analyze your commitments and make more conscious decisions about them.

**Practical Suggestions for Beginners:**

*   **Start Small:** Begin by focusing on recognizing Commitment and Consistency Bias in everyday situations.  Observe how it influences your own minor decisions and the marketing tactics you encounter.
*   **Reflect Daily:**  At the end of each day, take a few minutes to reflect on your decisions.  Were you influenced by the desire for consistency?  Did it lead to a positive or negative outcome?
*   **Practice Questioning "Shoulds":**  Pay attention to your internal "shoulds" and "ought tos."  Often, these are driven by the desire for consistency.  Question these "shoulds."  Are they truly based on your current values and goals, or are they just echoes of past commitments?
*   **Embrace "Inconsistency" Mindfully:**  Experiment with intentionally being "inconsistent" in minor, low-stakes situations.  Change your routine slightly, try a different approach, or express a slightly different opinion.  This can help you become more comfortable with flexibility and less rigidly bound by the need for consistency.

By consistently practicing these steps and exercises, you can develop a stronger awareness of Commitment and Consistency Bias and learn to apply it consciously and critically in your life, leading to better decisions and greater personal effectiveness.

## 8. Conclusion: Embracing Conscious Consistency

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is the difference between "commitment" and "consistency" in the context of this bias?**

In Commitment and Consistency Bias, "commitment" refers to the initial action, statement, or promise that sets the stage. "Consistency" is the subsequent behavior driven by the desire to align with that initial commitment.  Commitment is the anchor, and consistency is the effort to remain aligned with that anchor.

**2. Is Commitment and Consistency Bias always a bad thing?**

No, not at all. It can be a powerful force for good. It helps us build habits, maintain reliable relationships, and stay true to our values.  Consistency is essential for building trust and achieving long-term goals. The problem arises when the desire for consistency becomes *blind* and irrational, leading to poor decisions or manipulation.

**3. How can I spot Commitment and Consistency Bias in others?**

Look for situations where individuals are stubbornly defending past decisions or actions, even in the face of contradictory evidence.  Notice if someone seems overly concerned with appearing consistent, even at the expense of logic or practicality.  Be aware of persuasion tactics that start with small requests and escalate to larger ones.

**4. How can I avoid being manipulated by tactics that exploit this bias?**

Awareness is your best defense.  When faced with a request or offer, take a step back and ask yourself: "Am I agreeing to this because it genuinely aligns with my current goals and values, or am I feeling pressured to be consistent with a prior, perhaps small, commitment?"  Don't be afraid to say "no" or change your mind, even if you've made prior commitments. Seek external advice if you're unsure.

**5. Is Commitment and Consistency Bias the same as stubbornness?**

While related, it's not exactly the same as stubbornness. Stubbornness is a personality trait characterized by resistance to change or persuasion. Commitment and Consistency Bias is a cognitive bias that can affect anyone, regardless of personality.  It's a more fundamental psychological drive to maintain consistency, which can manifest as stubbornness in some cases, but also operates in more subtle and subconscious ways.  You can be influenced by Commitment and Consistency Bias without necessarily being a "stubborn" person in general.
