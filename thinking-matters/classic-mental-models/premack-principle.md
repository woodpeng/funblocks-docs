# The Premack Principle: Mastering Motivation with the "First Work, Then Play" Mental Model

## 1. Introduction: Unlock Your Potential with the Premack Principle

Have you ever struggled to start a task you know you *should* do, only to find yourself easily diving into activities you *want* to do? We've all been there.  Whether it's tackling a daunting work project, hitting the gym, or finally cleaning out that cluttered closet, motivation can feel like a fickle friend. But what if there was a simple, yet powerful mental model that could help you harness your natural inclinations to boost your productivity and achieve your goals?  Enter the **Premack Principle**, a cornerstone of behavioral psychology, often summarized as "Grandma's Rule" or "First work, then play."

This mental model isn't just about discipline; it's about understanding and leveraging how our minds are naturally wired. In a world saturated with distractions and competing priorities, the Premack Principle offers a practical, scientifically-backed strategy to overcome procrastination and cultivate desired habits. It's not about forcing yourself to do things you dislike, but rather ingeniously linking them to activities you naturally enjoy. By understanding and applying this principle, you can transform your approach to motivation, making it less of a struggle and more of a strategic game.

The Premack Principle, at its core, is elegantly simple: **More probable behaviors will reinforce less probable behaviors.**  In simpler terms, activities you are more likely to do can be used to motivate you to engage in activities you are less likely to do. This seemingly straightforward concept holds profound implications for personal productivity, education, business management, and even technological design.  It's a key to unlocking intrinsic motivation by tapping into your existing behavioral tendencies. Let's delve deeper into this fascinating mental model and discover how you can leverage it to your advantage.

## 2. Historical Background: From Rats in Boxes to Everyday Life

The story of the Premack Principle begins in the realm of experimental psychology, specifically within the school of behaviorism.  Behaviorism, dominant in the early to mid-20th century, focused on observable behaviors and how they are learned through conditioning.  Central to this field was the concept of reinforcement – how certain consequences increase the likelihood of a behavior being repeated.  Think of Pavlov's dogs salivating at the sound of a bell, or Skinner's rats pressing levers for food – behaviorists sought to understand the fundamental principles governing how we learn and act.

The man behind the Premack Principle is **David Premack**, an American psychologist who made significant contributions to the study of both human and animal cognition.  Born in 1925, Premack's early research focused on animal learning, particularly in primates.  He was interested in understanding not just *what* animals could learn, but also *how* their motivations and preferences shaped their learning processes.  In the 1950s and 1960s, Premack conducted a series of groundbreaking experiments that challenged some conventional views of reinforcement.

One of Premack's most famous studies involved children and the behaviors of eating candy and playing with pinball machines. He observed that some children naturally preferred eating candy, while others preferred playing pinball.  Crucially, he found that for children who preferred pinball, playing pinball could be used as a reinforcer for eating candy. Conversely, for children who preferred candy, eating candy could reinforce playing pinball.  This was a pivotal discovery because it shifted the focus from tangible rewards (like food or money) to the behaviors themselves as potential reinforcers.

Premack formalized these observations into what he initially called the **Relativity Theory of Reinforcement**, later becoming known as the Premack Principle.  His 1965 paper, "Reinforcement theory," published in the Nebraska Symposium on Motivation, is considered a foundational work in this area.  He argued that reinforcement is not about the stimulus itself, but about the *relative probability* of different behaviors.  What acts as a reinforcer is context-dependent and varies based on individual preferences and behavioral hierarchies.

Over time, the Premack Principle has evolved from a purely experimental finding in behavioral psychology to a widely recognized and applied mental model.  Its simplicity and practical implications have made it accessible and valuable across diverse fields.  While initially rooted in animal and child studies, its relevance to adult behavior, organizational management, and even technological design became increasingly clear.  It moved beyond the laboratory and into everyday life, becoming a powerful tool for self-motivation and behavioral change, solidifying its place as a key concept in understanding human motivation and behavior.

## 3. Core Concepts Analysis: Decoding the "First Work, Then Play" Strategy

At the heart of the Premack Principle lies the distinction between two types of behaviors: **high-probability behaviors (HPBs)** and **low-probability behaviors (LPBs)**.  Understanding this distinction is crucial to grasping how this mental model works.

**High-Probability Behaviors (HPBs):** These are activities you are naturally inclined to do. They are your go-to choices, the things you gravitate towards when you have free time or when you're seeking pleasure or relaxation.  HPBs are often enjoyable, easy, or habitual.  Think of them as your default settings – the activities that require little to no external motivation.  Examples of HPBs could include:

* Checking social media
* Watching your favorite TV show
* Playing video games
* Listening to music
* Going for a walk in nature
* Chatting with friends
* Enjoying a hobby

**Low-Probability Behaviors (LPBs):** These are activities you are less likely to engage in spontaneously. They are often perceived as less enjoyable, more challenging, or requiring more effort.  LPBs are the tasks you might procrastinate on, the habits you struggle to form, or the responsibilities you tend to put off. Examples of LPBs could include:

* Working on a complex project
* Studying for an exam
* Exercising regularly
* Cleaning your house
* Writing a report
* Practicing a musical instrument
* Making healthy food choices

The Premack Principle states that you can **increase the likelihood of engaging in an LPB by making access to an HPB contingent upon completing the LPB.**  In essence, you use the allure of your preferred activities (HPBs) to incentivize yourself to tackle less desirable tasks (LPBs).  It's about creating a behavioral contract with yourself: "If I do X (LPB), then I get to do Y (HPB)."

**Analogy 1: The Dessert Dilemma:** Imagine a child who dislikes eating vegetables (LPB) but loves dessert (HPB).  A parent using the Premack Principle might say, "You can have dessert *after* you finish your vegetables."  The desirable dessert becomes the reward for completing the less desirable vegetables, making the child more likely to eat their greens.

**Analogy 2: The Homework & Games Scenario:**  A student might dread doing homework (LPB) but eagerly anticipates playing video games (HPB).  Applying the Premack Principle, the student can decide, "I will play video games *after* I complete one hour of homework."  The fun activity of gaming becomes the motivator for tackling the less exciting task of studying.

**Analogy 3: The Workout & Relaxation Routine:** Someone might find exercising (LPB) challenging to initiate but loves relaxing with a good book (HPB).  They can create a Premack-based routine: "I will read my book *after* I complete a 30-minute workout."  The enjoyable relaxation time becomes the reward for pushing through the exercise.

**Key Principles in Action:**

1. **Identify Your HPBs and LPBs:** The first step is self-awareness.  Reflect on your daily activities and honestly assess which behaviors you naturally gravitate towards (HPBs) and which ones you tend to avoid (LPBs).  This is highly personal and can vary greatly from person to person.

2. **Establish Contingency:**  Link your LPB to your HPB by making access to the HPB dependent on completing the LPB.  The structure should always be: LPB *then* HPB.  The HPB acts as the "reinforcer" for the LPB.

3. **Ensure Immediacy (When Possible):** Ideally, the HPB should follow the LPB relatively soon. The closer in time the reward is to the effort, the stronger the reinforcement effect.  However, the "reward" doesn't always need to be *immediately* after, as long as the contingency is clear and understood.

4. **Be Consistent:** Like any habit-building strategy, consistency is key.  Regularly applying the Premack Principle will strengthen the association between LPBs and HPBs, making it more effective over time.

5. **Personalize and Adjust:** What constitutes an HPB and LPB is subjective.  Tailor the principle to your own preferences and adjust as needed.  If a particular HPB loses its motivating power, switch it to another, or adjust the duration of the LPB and HPB.

By understanding these core concepts and principles, you can begin to strategically apply the Premack Principle to motivate yourself and others to tackle less desirable tasks and build more productive habits. It's about working *with* your natural inclinations, not against them, to achieve your goals.

## 4. Practical Applications: Unleashing the Premack Principle in Diverse Domains

The Premack Principle isn't confined to the psychology lab; it's a versatile mental model with broad applicability across various aspects of life.  Let's explore five specific application cases:

**1. Business & Management: Boosting Employee Motivation and Productivity**

In the workplace, the Premack Principle can be a powerful tool for motivating employees and enhancing productivity.  Instead of relying solely on extrinsic rewards like bonuses (which can sometimes be demotivating if not perceived as fair or achievable), managers can leverage intrinsic motivators by structuring tasks using the Premack Principle.

* **Application Scenario:** A team needs to complete a tedious data entry project (LPB) before they can move on to the more creative and engaging task of brainstorming new marketing campaigns (HPB).  The manager can frame it as: "Once we finish the data entry, we can dedicate the afternoon to brainstorming and developing exciting new marketing strategies."  The prospect of working on the more enjoyable brainstorming session (HPB) becomes the motivator to complete the less exciting data entry (LPB).

* **Analysis:** This approach taps into the team's inherent desire for creative work (HPB). By making the preferred activity contingent on completing the less preferred task, it increases motivation and efficiency in finishing the data entry.  It also fosters a sense of progress and reward within the workday itself, rather than relying solely on external rewards.

**2. Personal Life & Habit Formation: Building Positive Routines**

In our personal lives, the Premack Principle is invaluable for building positive habits and breaking negative ones.  It can help us overcome procrastination and establish routines for self-improvement.

* **Application Scenario:** Someone wants to establish a regular exercise routine (LPB) but finds it difficult to get started.  They enjoy relaxing with a cup of coffee and reading the news in the morning (HPB).  They can apply the Premack Principle by deciding: "I will enjoy my coffee and news *after* I complete a 30-minute workout each morning."

* **Analysis:**  The enjoyable morning ritual of coffee and news (HPB) becomes the reward and motivation for engaging in the less initially appealing activity of exercise (LPB).  This creates a positive association with exercise and makes it more likely to become a consistent habit.

**3. Education: Enhancing Student Engagement and Learning**

Teachers can effectively use the Premack Principle in the classroom to motivate students to engage in less preferred learning activities by linking them to more enjoyable ones.

* **Application Scenario:**  Students might find grammar exercises (LPB) less engaging than playing educational games (HPB).  A teacher can structure classroom time as: "After we complete 20 minutes of grammar exercises, we can spend 15 minutes playing the vocabulary game."

* **Analysis:**  The fun and interactive game (HPB) serves as a motivator for students to focus on and complete the grammar exercises (LPB). This makes learning more engaging and can improve student participation and knowledge retention in subjects they might otherwise find less appealing.

**4. Technology & Product Design:  Improving User Engagement and Experience**

In the realm of technology and product design, the Premack Principle can be applied to enhance user engagement and guide user behavior towards desired actions.

* **Application Scenario:**  A fitness app wants users to consistently log their meals (LPB – often seen as tedious).  The app can be designed so that users unlock access to personalized workout recommendations and progress visualizations (HPB – highly desired features) *after* they have logged their meals for the day.

* **Analysis:**  Access to the valuable and motivating features of personalized workouts and progress tracking (HPB) is made contingent on the user performing the less preferred task of meal logging (LPB). This encourages users to engage with the meal logging feature, increasing data collection and ultimately enhancing the app's value proposition.

**5. Healthcare & Therapy: Promoting Patient Adherence and Behavior Change**

In healthcare and therapy, the Premack Principle can be a useful strategy for promoting patient adherence to treatment plans and encouraging positive behavior changes.

* **Application Scenario:**  A patient needs to perform physical therapy exercises (LPB) to recover from an injury.  They enjoy listening to their favorite podcasts (HPB).  The therapist can advise them to: "Listen to your favorite podcast *only while* you are doing your physical therapy exercises."

* **Analysis:**  The enjoyable activity of listening to podcasts (HPB) is linked exclusively to the less preferred task of physical therapy exercises (LPB). This can make the exercises more tolerable and even enjoyable, increasing patient adherence to their rehabilitation program and improving recovery outcomes.

These examples illustrate the versatility of the Premack Principle.  By understanding the concept of HPBs and LPBs, and strategically linking them, we can create motivational structures in various domains to drive desired behaviors and achieve our goals, whether in business, personal life, education, technology, or healthcare.

## 5. Comparison with Related Mental Models: Navigating the Motivational Landscape

The Premack Principle is a powerful tool for motivation, but it's not the only mental model in this domain.  Understanding its relationship to other related models can help you choose the most effective approach for different situations. Let's compare it with two key related mental models: [Operant Conditioning](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/operant-conditioning) and [Incentives](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/incentives).

**Premack Principle vs. Operant Conditioning**

[Operant Conditioning](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/operant-conditioning) is a broader theory of learning that explains how behaviors are influenced by their consequences.  It involves concepts like reinforcement (increasing behavior) and punishment (decreasing behavior), using both positive (adding something) and negative (removing something) stimuli.

* **Similarities:** Both the Premack Principle and Operant Conditioning rely on the idea of reinforcement to shape behavior.  The Premack Principle can be seen as a specific type of positive reinforcement within Operant Conditioning.  In both models, a desired outcome (reinforcer) is used to increase the likelihood of a behavior.

* **Differences:** Operant Conditioning is a broader framework encompassing various types of reinforcement and punishment, often involving external rewards or consequences.  The Premack Principle is more narrowly focused on using behaviors themselves as reinforcers.  It emphasizes the *relative probability* of behaviors rather than external stimuli.  Operant Conditioning can use tangible rewards (food, money, praise), while the Premack Principle uses access to a more probable behavior as the reward for a less probable one.

* **When to Choose Premack Principle:** The Premack Principle is particularly useful when you want to leverage intrinsic motivation by using naturally occurring, preferred activities as reinforcers. It's effective when you want to create a system of self-motivation or when external rewards are less feasible or desirable. Operant Conditioning is broader and may be more appropriate when you need to use external rewards or punishments to shape behavior, especially in situations where intrinsic motivation is lacking or insufficient.

**Premack Principle vs. Incentives**

[Incentives](/thinking-matters/classic-mental-models/incentives) are external motivators designed to encourage specific behaviors.  They can be tangible (rewards like bonuses, promotions) or intangible (recognition, praise).

* **Similarities:** Both incentives and the Premack Principle aim to motivate behavior.  Incentives often act as reinforcers, increasing the likelihood of desired actions. The Premack Principle can be viewed as a form of incentive, where the "incentive" is access to a high-probability behavior.

* **Differences:** Incentives are typically external rewards provided by someone else (e.g., a manager, a parent).  The Premack Principle is more about self-motivation and setting up internal contingencies. Incentives often involve adding something external, while the Premack Principle works by structuring the sequence of existing behaviors. Incentives can sometimes be perceived as manipulative or can lose their effectiveness over time if they become expected. The Premack Principle leverages natural preferences and can be more sustainable as it taps into intrinsic motivation.

* **When to Choose Premack Principle:** The Premack Principle is a good choice when you want to foster self-discipline and intrinsic motivation, or when external incentives are not readily available or appropriate. It's effective for personal habit formation and for creating internal motivation within teams or individuals. Incentives are more suitable when you need to externally motivate a group or individual to perform specific tasks, especially when the tasks are not inherently enjoyable and require external encouragement.

**Choosing the Right Model:**

The choice between the Premack Principle, Operant Conditioning, and Incentives depends on the context, the desired outcome, and the nature of the behavior you want to influence.  The Premack Principle shines when you want to tap into intrinsic motivation and leverage existing behavioral tendencies.  Operant Conditioning provides a broader framework for shaping behavior using various types of consequences, while Incentives are effective for externally motivating specific actions with rewards.  Often, a combination of these approaches can be the most effective strategy for comprehensive behavior change and motivation.

## 6. Critical Thinking: Navigating Limitations and Avoiding Misuse

While the Premack Principle is a powerful motivational tool, it's essential to approach it with critical thinking and be aware of its limitations and potential pitfalls.

**Limitations and Drawbacks:**

* **Individual Variability:** The effectiveness of the Premack Principle heavily relies on accurately identifying individual HPBs and LPBs. What is a high-probability behavior for one person might be a low-probability behavior for another. Misjudging these preferences can render the principle ineffective.  Furthermore, preferences can change over time, requiring ongoing adjustments to the strategy.

* **Not Universally Applicable:**  The Premack Principle might not be suitable for all types of behaviors or situations. For very complex or deeply ingrained behaviors, or in cases of severe lack of motivation, simply linking behaviors might not be enough.  In such scenarios, other motivational strategies or therapeutic interventions might be necessary.

* **Potential for Diminishing Returns:**  If the same HPB is used repeatedly as a reinforcer for various LPBs, it might lose its appeal over time.  The "reward" can become less motivating if it's too readily available or if the novelty wears off.  It's important to vary HPBs or adjust the frequency and intensity of application to maintain effectiveness.

* **Ethical Considerations:** In some contexts, particularly when applied to others (e.g., in parenting or management), the Premack Principle can be perceived as manipulative if not used transparently and ethically.  It's crucial to ensure that the application is fair, respectful, and aligned with the individual's best interests, rather than solely for control or exploitation.

**Potential Misuse Cases:**

* **Manipulation:** Using the Premack Principle to subtly manipulate individuals into doing things against their will or best interests is a misuse.  For instance, promising excessive or inappropriate rewards to coerce someone into unethical behavior.

* **Creating Unhealthy Dependencies:**  Over-reliance on external HPBs as reinforcers can hinder the development of intrinsic motivation for LPBs themselves.  The goal should ideally be to gradually make the LPB more enjoyable or intrinsically rewarding over time, rather than perpetually relying on external HPBs.

* **Ignoring Underlying Issues:**  Simply applying the Premack Principle might mask underlying issues causing low-probability behavior, such as anxiety, depression, or lack of skill. Addressing these root causes is crucial for long-term behavioral change, and the Premack Principle should be seen as a supportive tool, not a standalone solution.

**Avoiding Common Misconceptions:**

* **It's Not Bribery:** The Premack Principle is not bribery. Bribery involves offering rewards *before* a behavior to induce it, often in unethical or inappropriate contexts. The Premack Principle is about setting up a contingency where a desired activity is earned *after* completing a less desired one. It's about structuring behavior, not offering illicit inducements.

* **It's Not Always Instant Gratification:** While ideally, the HPB should follow the LPB relatively soon, it's not always about instant gratification.  The timeframe can be adjusted based on the context and the individual.  The key is the clear understanding of the contingency: LPB *then* HPB.

* **It's Not a One-Size-Fits-All Solution:**  The Premack Principle is a flexible framework, but it requires personalization and adaptation.  What works for one person or situation might not work for another.  Experimentation and adjustment are crucial for successful implementation.

**Advice for Effective and Ethical Application:**

* **Transparency and Communication:** When applying the Premack Principle to others, be transparent about the approach. Explain the rationale and the benefits.  This fosters trust and cooperation, rather than creating a sense of manipulation.

* **Focus on Positive Reinforcement:**  Emphasize the positive aspects of both the LPB and the HPB. Frame it as a way to make tasks more manageable and rewarding, rather than as a way to control or force behavior.

* **Regular Review and Adjustment:**  Continuously monitor the effectiveness of the Premack Principle in your specific context.  Be prepared to adjust HPBs, LPBs, or the contingency structure as needed to maintain motivation and achieve desired outcomes.

* **Combine with Other Strategies:**  The Premack Principle is most effective when used in conjunction with other motivational and behavioral change strategies.  Consider combining it with goal setting, habit tracking, mindfulness, or addressing any underlying psychological or skill-based barriers.

By being mindful of these limitations, potential misuses, and misconceptions, and by applying the Premack Principle ethically and thoughtfully, you can harness its power effectively while mitigating its risks.

## 7. Practical Guide: Implementing the Premack Principle in Your Life

Ready to put the Premack Principle into action? Here’s a step-by-step guide to get you started:

**Step-by-Step Operational Guide:**

1. **Identify Your Low-Probability Behavior (LPB):**  Pinpoint the task, habit, or activity you want to do more of but consistently struggle with. Be specific. Instead of "be more productive," try "write for 30 minutes each morning," or "exercise 3 times a week."

2. **Identify Your High-Probability Behavior (HPB):**  Determine the activities you naturally enjoy and frequently engage in. These are your go-to pleasures, your easy wins.  Make a list of at least 5-10 HPBs.  Examples: checking social media, watching videos, listening to music, reading for pleasure, taking a coffee break, chatting with friends, playing a game, etc.

3. **Establish the Premack Contingency:**  Create a clear "If...then..." statement linking your LPB and HPB.  The format is always: "If I complete [LPB], then I can [HPB]."  Be precise about the duration or completion criteria for the LPB and HPB.  Examples:
    * "If I write for 30 minutes, then I can check social media for 15 minutes."
    * "If I finish my report draft, then I can watch an episode of my favorite show."
    * "If I go for a 45-minute run, then I can enjoy a relaxing bath."

4. **Implement and Be Consistent:** Start applying your Premack contingency immediately.  Stick to your "If...then..." rule.  Only allow yourself access to the HPB *after* you have completed the LPB. Consistency is key to building the association and making the principle effective.

5. **Monitor and Adjust:**  Track your progress and observe how well the Premack Principle is working for you.  Are you consistently completing your LPBs?  Is the HPB still motivating?  If not, don't be afraid to adjust.  You might need to:
    * **Change the HPB:** If your chosen HPB loses its appeal, swap it for another from your list.
    * **Adjust the LPB duration:**  If the LPB is too daunting, start with shorter durations and gradually increase them as you build momentum.
    * **Refine the HPB duration:**  Ensure the HPB "reward" feels appropriately motivating. It shouldn't be too short to feel rewarding, nor too long to disrupt your overall schedule.

**Practical Suggestions for Beginners:**

* **Start Small:** Begin with one or two LPBs you want to tackle. Don't overwhelm yourself by trying to apply the Premack Principle to everything at once.

* **Focus on Immediate HPBs:** In the beginning, choose HPBs that can be enjoyed relatively soon after completing the LPB to strengthen the association.

* **Write it Down:**  Physically write down your Premack contingencies.  This makes them more concrete and serves as a visual reminder of your commitment.

* **Be Patient:**  Like any new habit, it takes time for the Premack Principle to become fully effective. Don't get discouraged if you don't see results immediately.  Consistency is crucial.

* **Celebrate Small Wins:** Acknowledge and appreciate your progress, even small steps. This reinforces positive behavior and builds momentum.

harnessing the Premack Principle to boost your motivation and achieve your goals in various aspects of your life.

## 8. Conclusion: Embrace the Power of Behavioral Sequencing

The Premack Principle, at its core, is a testament to the power of understanding our own behavioral tendencies. It’s a simple yet profound mental model that empowers us to work *with* our natural inclinations rather than constantly fighting against them. By recognizing that more probable behaviors can act as potent reinforcers for less probable ones, we unlock a strategic approach to motivation that is both effective and sustainable.

We've journeyed from the historical origins of this principle in behaviorist psychology, through its core concepts and practical applications across diverse domains, to a critical analysis of its limitations and a hands-on guide for implementation.  The "First work, then play" mantra, while seemingly simplistic, encapsulates a powerful truth about human motivation: we are more likely to do what we *should* when we know we'll be rewarded with what we *want*.

The significance of the Premack Principle in modern thinking and decision-making is undeniable. In a world overflowing with distractions and demanding constant self-regulation, this mental model offers a practical framework for enhancing productivity, building positive habits, and achieving personal and professional goals.  It encourages us to think strategically about our daily routines, to identify our natural motivators, and to structure our tasks in a way that leverages our innate preferences.

By integrating the Premack Principle into your thinking processes, you gain a valuable tool for self-management and motivation.  It's not about magically making disliked tasks enjoyable, but about skillfully orchestrating your behaviors to make them more manageable and rewarding. Embrace the power of behavioral sequencing, and you'll find yourself more effectively tackling challenges, building desired habits, and unlocking your full potential, one "First work, then play" sequence at a time.

## Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)

**1. What is the Premack Principle in simple terms?**
The Premack Principle, also known as "Grandma's Rule," means you can motivate yourself to do something you don't want to do (like chores or work tasks) by promising yourself something you *do* want to do (like watching TV or playing games) *after* you finish the first task.  It's using a preferred activity as a reward for a less preferred one.

**2. Is the Premack Principle the same as bribery?**
No, it's not bribery. Bribery is usually offering something (often unethical or inappropriate) *before* someone does something to induce them to act. The Premack Principle is about setting up a contingency: you earn a reward (a preferred activity) *after* you complete a less preferred activity. It's a structured approach to motivation, not an illicit inducement.

**3. Does the Premack Principle work for everyone?**
While generally effective, the Premack Principle's effectiveness depends on individual preferences and contexts. What is a "high-probability behavior" varies from person to person.  It might not work for everyone in all situations, especially for deeply ingrained issues or lack of motivation. It's a tool, not a magic bullet, and requires personalization and adaptation.

**4. What are some examples of high-probability behaviors?**
Examples of high-probability behaviors (HPBs) are activities people naturally enjoy and do frequently. These can include: checking social media, watching TV/movies, playing video games, listening to music, hobbies, spending time with friends, eating favorite snacks, relaxing with a book, going for a walk, etc.  HPBs are personal and vary from person to person.

**5. How do I identify my own high-probability and low-probability behaviors?**
To identify your HPBs and LPBs, reflect on your daily routine.  Think about activities you naturally gravitate towards and enjoy (HPBs) and tasks you tend to procrastinate on or dislike doing (LPBs).  Keep a journal for a few days to track your activities and your feelings towards them. This self-reflection will help you pinpoint your personal HPBs and LPBs.
