## 6. How We Handle Children's Personal Information

We attach great importance to the protection of children's personal information. Our products, websites, and services are mainly for adults. Without the consent of parents or guardians, children should not create their user accounts. Although the definition of children may vary according to local laws and customs, we consider anyone under 14 years old as a child. In cases where we collect information about child users with the consent of parents or guardians, we will only store, use, or disclose this information if allowed by law, explicitly agreed by parents or guardians, or necessary for the protection of children. Otherwise, we will try to delete the relevant data as soon as possible. Given the limitations of existing technology and business models, we find it challenging to proactively identify children's personal information. If you discover that we have collected personal information about a child without your knowledge or without obtaining verifiable consent from a guardian, you can contact us promptly. We will try to delete it promptly upon discovery. If we discover such a situation ourselves, we will also delete it promptly, except for data that legal requirements mandate us to retain.
