# Unlock Your Creative Potential: A Deep Dive into Lateral Thinking

## 1. Introduction

Imagine you're faced with a seemingly impossible puzzle. You stare at it, trying the same solutions repeatedly, each time hitting a dead end. Frustration mounts.  This is often how we approach problems in life – with linear, step-by-step thinking, which we can call "vertical thinking." But what if there was another way, a method to sidestep the obvious, to approach the problem from an entirely different angle? This is where **Lateral Thinking** comes into play.

Lateral thinking is a powerful mental model that encourages us to break free from conventional thought patterns and explore unconventional, creative solutions. It's about moving sideways to solve problems, rather than straight ahead. Think of it like this: vertical thinking digs deeper in the same hole, hoping to find water. Lateral thinking suggests we might be digging in the wrong place altogether and encourages us to explore different locations.

In our rapidly evolving world, where challenges are increasingly complex and multifaceted, lateral thinking is more crucial than ever.  Traditional, linear approaches often fall short when dealing with novel problems requiring innovative solutions. Businesses need to innovate to stay competitive, individuals need creative solutions to personal dilemmas, and society as a whole needs fresh perspectives to tackle global issues. Lateral thinking provides us with the tools to generate those fresh perspectives, to see possibilities where others see roadblocks, and to unlock innovative solutions that might otherwise remain hidden.

Therefore, mastering lateral thinking isn't just about becoming more creative; it's about becoming a more effective problem-solver, a more adaptable thinker, and a more valuable asset in any domain.  It empowers you to challenge assumptions, generate new ideas, and ultimately, to think differently.

**Definition:** Lateral thinking is a deliberate and systematic approach to problem-solving that involves generating ideas by intentionally moving away from traditional, linear thought patterns. It emphasizes indirect and creative approaches, challenging assumptions, and exploring multiple perspectives to arrive at novel and effective solutions. It's about thinking "outside the box" and finding unexpected pathways to overcome challenges.

## 2. Historical Background: The Genesis of Sideways Thinking

The concept of lateral thinking is not some ancient philosophical doctrine, but a relatively modern mental model, primarily attributed to **Edward de Bono**, a Maltese physician, psychologist, and author. De Bono formally introduced and popularized the term "lateral thinking" in his 1967 book, *The Use of Lateral Thinking*. While the *idea* of creative problem-solving existed long before, De Bono provided a structured framework and vocabulary to understand and apply this type of thinking systematically.

De Bono's background in medicine and psychology greatly influenced his development of lateral thinking. He observed that the human brain often falls into patterns of thought, creating ruts that limit creativity and problem-solving. He argued that traditional education and logical reasoning, while valuable, often emphasize vertical thinking – a linear, step-by-step approach focused on logic and analysis within established frameworks.  He saw the need for a complementary approach that could break free from these ruts and generate new ideas.

His initial work focused on distinguishing lateral thinking from what he termed "vertical thinking."  Vertical thinking, in De Bono's view, is characterized by its sequential nature, its reliance on logic and analysis, and its focus on selecting and refining existing ideas. It's about being right at each step and moving logically towards a solution within a defined framework.  Lateral thinking, on the other hand, is about generating new ideas, exploring different angles, and being willing to be "wrong" along the way to discover a better solution.

*The Use of Lateral Thinking* became a seminal work, laying the foundation for the model. De Bono continued to develop and refine the concept in subsequent books and workshops, introducing tools and techniques like **provocation**, **random entry**, and **concept fan**. He emphasized that lateral thinking is not just about brainstorming or random idea generation, but a deliberate process that can be learned and practiced.

Over time, lateral thinking has evolved from a somewhat niche concept to a widely recognized and valued skill in various fields.  Initially, it was primarily adopted in business and management training to enhance creativity and innovation.  However, its application has broadened significantly, extending into education, personal development, and even areas like conflict resolution and social problem-solving.

De Bono's contributions are immense. He not only coined the term "lateral thinking" but also provided a practical methodology for applying it. He demystified creativity, showing that it wasn't just an innate talent but a skill that could be cultivated through specific techniques. His work has had a profound impact on how we understand and approach problem-solving, shifting the focus from solely relying on logic and analysis to embracing creativity and innovation as essential components of effective thinking.  While some critics have questioned the scientific rigor of De Bono's approach, the practical value and widespread adoption of lateral thinking in diverse fields speak volumes about its effectiveness and enduring relevance.

## 3. Core Concepts Analysis: Deconstructing Sideways Thought

Lateral thinking, at its heart, is about challenging assumptions and breaking free from established thought patterns to generate new ideas.  Let's delve into the key components and principles that underpin this powerful mental model.

**1. Escaping Dominant Ideas:**

One of the biggest obstacles to creative problem-solving is our tendency to get stuck in dominant ideas or obvious solutions. These are the conventional approaches, the "tried and true" methods that often prevent us from seeing alternative possibilities. Lateral thinking actively encourages us to identify and escape these dominant ideas.

* **Example:** Imagine you need to design a better mousetrap.  The dominant idea is likely a spring-loaded trap that snaps shut. Vertical thinking might focus on improving the spring mechanism or the bait. Lateral thinking, however, would challenge the dominant idea of "trapping" mice altogether.  Perhaps the solution isn't to trap them, but to repel them, or to make your house less attractive to mice in the first place.  This shift in perspective opens up entirely new avenues for solutions.

**2. Provocation:**

Provocation is a core technique in lateral thinking. It involves deliberately introducing illogical or seemingly irrelevant ideas to disrupt our usual thought patterns and stimulate new connections.  These "provocations" are not meant to be solutions themselves, but rather stepping stones to new ideas.

* **Example:**  Let's say a restaurant wants to improve customer service. A provocation could be "Customers should serve themselves."  This is illogical for a full-service restaurant. However, this provocation can lead to ideas like: "How can we empower customers to have more control over their dining experience?" This might spark ideas like interactive ordering systems, customizable meal options, or even self-service drink stations, all aimed at improving customer satisfaction in unconventional ways.

**3. Random Entry:**

Random entry is another powerful technique for breaking mental ruts. It involves introducing a random word, image, or object into your thinking process to trigger new associations and perspectives. The random element disrupts your linear thought flow and forces your brain to make unexpected connections.

* **Example:**  A company is struggling to come up with new marketing slogans for their eco-friendly cleaning products. They use a random word generator and get the word "ocean."  At first glance, "ocean" seems unrelated to cleaning products. However, using "ocean" as a random entry point, they might start thinking about the ocean's vastness, its cleanliness (in certain areas), or the importance of ocean conservation. This could lead to slogans that emphasize the product's natural ingredients, its contribution to a cleaner planet, or even a campaign to support ocean cleanup initiatives.

**4. Alternatives and Multiple Perspectives:**

Lateral thinking emphasizes generating multiple alternatives and considering problems from various perspectives.  It's not about finding the *right* answer immediately, but about exploring a wide range of possibilities before settling on a solution. This involves actively seeking out different viewpoints and challenging your own assumptions.

* **Example:** A school is dealing with increased student absenteeism. Vertical thinking might focus on stricter attendance policies and punishments. Lateral thinking would encourage exploring alternative perspectives.  Why are students absent?  Are they bored?  Are they facing challenges at home? Are the classes engaging? By considering the problem from the students' perspective, the school might discover that more engaging teaching methods, better student support systems, or addressing bullying issues could be more effective solutions than simply punishing absenteeism.

**5. Concept Fan:**

The concept fan is a visual tool used in lateral thinking to expand ideas and explore different levels of generality. Starting with a central concept or problem, you branch out to generate increasingly broader and more abstract ideas, and then narrow down to more specific and practical solutions.

* **Example:**  The central concept is "Improving City Transportation."  Using a concept fan, you might branch out to:
    * **Broader Concepts:**  "Mobility," "Accessibility," "Sustainability," "Efficiency."
    * **More Specific Ideas:** "Electric buses," "Bike-sharing programs," "Traffic signal optimization," "Remote work initiatives."
    * **Even More Specific Solutions:** "Implementing a city-wide network of electric scooter rentals," "Developing a mobile app for real-time bus tracking and route planning," "Creating carpool lanes on major highways."

By using the concept fan, you move from a general problem to a range of potential solutions, exploring different levels of abstraction and detail.

These core concepts – escaping dominant ideas, provocation, random entry, multiple perspectives, and the concept fan – form the foundation of lateral thinking. They are not isolated techniques but rather interconnected principles that work together to foster a more creative and innovative approach to problem-solving.  By consciously applying these principles, you can break free from mental ruts, generate novel ideas, and unlock solutions that would remain hidden within the confines of vertical thinking.

## 4. Practical Applications: Lateral Thinking in Action

Lateral thinking isn't just a theoretical concept; it's a highly practical mental model with wide-ranging applications across diverse domains. Let's explore five specific examples of how lateral thinking can be applied in real-world scenarios.

**1. Business Innovation & Marketing:**

In the competitive business world, innovation is paramount. Lateral thinking is a powerful tool for generating disruptive ideas and creating a competitive edge.  Companies can use lateral thinking techniques to develop new products, services, and marketing campaigns that stand out from the crowd.

* **Application Scenario:** A coffee shop chain is struggling to differentiate itself from competitors.  Vertical thinking might focus on improving coffee quality or reducing prices. Lateral thinking encourages them to challenge the dominant idea of "just selling coffee." They might use provocation: "What if we don't sell coffee at all?"  This seemingly absurd idea could spark thinking about the *experience* they offer.  Perhaps they could become a community hub, offering workshops, live music, or co-working spaces, with coffee as just one element of a broader offering.  This lateral shift in perspective could lead to a unique business model that attracts a different customer base and creates a stronger brand identity.  For marketing, instead of traditional advertising, they might explore viral marketing campaigns that use unexpected and humorous approaches to capture attention, leveraging social media and word-of-mouth.

**2. Personal Problem Solving & Relationships:**

Lateral thinking isn't limited to professional settings; it's equally valuable in navigating personal challenges and improving relationships. When faced with personal dilemmas, we often get stuck in repetitive thought patterns. Lateral thinking can help us break free and find creative solutions in our personal lives.

* **Application Scenario:**  Imagine you're struggling with a persistent conflict with a family member. Vertical thinking might involve repeatedly arguing your point or trying to convince them they're wrong. Lateral thinking suggests a different approach.  Use random entry:  Pick a random object in your room – say, a "plant."  How does a plant relate to your relationship problem?  Plants need nurturing, understanding, and the right environment to grow.  This random association could lead to insights about the need for empathy, patience, and creating a more supportive "environment" for your relationship to improve.  Instead of focusing on "winning" the argument, you might shift to understanding their perspective, finding common ground, and exploring alternative ways to communicate and resolve the conflict.

**3. Education & Learning:**

Lateral thinking is a valuable tool for educators and students alike. It can enhance creativity in teaching methods, make learning more engaging, and help students develop critical thinking and problem-solving skills.

* **Application Scenario:** A teacher wants to make history lessons more engaging for students who find them boring. Vertical thinking might involve more lectures or stricter discipline. Lateral thinking suggests challenging the dominant idea of "passive learning."  Use provocation: "What if students taught themselves history?" This could lead to project-based learning, where students research and present historical events in creative formats like plays, documentaries, or interactive games.  Instead of passively receiving information, students become active learners, exploring history from different angles, developing research and presentation skills, and making the subject matter more relevant and engaging.

**4. Technology & Innovation:**

The tech industry thrives on innovation, and lateral thinking is essential for developing groundbreaking technologies and solutions. From software development to hardware design, lateral thinking can help tech professionals overcome technical hurdles and create truly innovative products.

* **Application Scenario:**  Engineers are trying to develop a more efficient battery for electric vehicles. Vertical thinking might focus on incremental improvements to existing battery technologies. Lateral thinking encourages them to challenge the dominant idea of "traditional batteries" altogether. They might use the concept fan.  Broaden the concept to "energy storage," then consider alternative technologies like fuel cells, supercapacitors, or even entirely new energy storage paradigms inspired by nature.  Random entry could be "honeycomb" – leading to ideas about battery cell structures that are more efficient and compact, mimicking the hexagonal structure of a honeycomb. This lateral approach can lead to breakthroughs that go beyond incremental improvements and revolutionize battery technology.

**5. Social Problem Solving & Public Policy:**

Many societal challenges require innovative solutions that go beyond traditional approaches. Lateral thinking can be applied to address complex social issues like poverty, climate change, and urban planning, by generating fresh perspectives and unconventional solutions.

* **Application Scenario:** A city is grappling with increasing traffic congestion. Vertical thinking might focus on building more roads or improving public transportation. Lateral thinking encourages challenging the dominant idea of "physical transportation."  Provocation: "What if people didn't need to travel at all?"  This could lead to exploring remote work initiatives, decentralized urban planning that brings jobs and services closer to residential areas, and promoting virtual communication technologies. By shifting the focus from managing traffic to reducing the *need* for traffic, lateral thinking opens up entirely new policy options and innovative solutions for urban mobility.

These examples illustrate the versatility of lateral thinking.  Whether it's in business, personal life, education, technology, or social issues, applying lateral thinking techniques can help you break free from conventional thinking, generate innovative ideas, and find more effective solutions to a wide range of challenges. It's about actively seeking out different perspectives, challenging assumptions, and embracing creativity as a core component of problem-solving.

## 5. Comparison with Related Mental Models

Lateral thinking, while powerful, is not the only mental model focused on creative problem-solving. It's helpful to understand how it relates to other similar models, such as [First Principles Thinking](/docs/thinking-toolkit/classic-mental-models/first-principles-thinking) and [Systems Thinking](/docs/thinking-toolkit/classic-mental-models/systems-thinking).

**Lateral Thinking vs. First Principles Thinking:**

Both lateral thinking and [First Principles Thinking](/docs/thinking-toolkit/classic-mental-models/first-principles-thinking) encourage challenging assumptions, but they approach it from different angles.  First principles thinking, popularized by figures like Elon Musk, focuses on breaking down a problem into its fundamental truths or "first principles" – the basic building blocks that cannot be further reduced.  From these fundamental truths, you reason upwards to construct new solutions.  It's about deconstructing existing knowledge and rebuilding it from the ground up.

* **Relationship:** Both models value questioning assumptions. First principles thinking deconstructs assumptions to identify fundamental truths, while lateral thinking challenges assumptions to escape dominant ideas.
* **Similarities:** Both promote critical thinking, originality, and going beyond conventional wisdom. Both can lead to innovative solutions by challenging the status quo.
* **Differences:** First principles thinking is more analytical and deductive, starting with fundamental truths and reasoning logically. Lateral thinking is more generative and exploratory, using techniques like provocation and random entry to spark new ideas. First principles is about *deconstruction and reconstruction*, lateral thinking is about *divergence and re-direction*.
* **When to Choose:** Use first principles thinking when you need to deeply understand the fundamentals of a problem and build solutions from scratch, especially in complex technical or scientific domains. Choose lateral thinking when you are stuck in conventional thinking patterns, need to generate a wide range of ideas quickly, or require creative solutions to less structured problems, especially in areas like marketing, design, or social innovation.

**Lateral Thinking vs. Systems Thinking:**

[Systems Thinking](/docs/thinking-toolkit/classic-mental-models/systems-thinking) is a mental model that emphasizes understanding problems within the context of larger systems. It focuses on interconnections, feedback loops, and emergent properties within complex systems, rather than isolating individual components. It's about seeing the "big picture" and understanding how different parts of a system interact and influence each other.

* **Relationship:** Both lateral thinking and systems thinking encourage broader perspectives, but systems thinking focuses on understanding interconnectedness, while lateral thinking focuses on generating diverse ideas.
* **Similarities:** Both models move beyond linear, narrow thinking. Both recognize the importance of context and multiple viewpoints in problem-solving.
* **Differences:** Systems thinking is primarily about understanding complexity and interrelationships within systems. Lateral thinking is primarily about generating novel ideas and breaking free from conventional thought patterns. Systems thinking is more analytical and diagnostic, while lateral thinking is more generative and solution-oriented.
* **When to Choose:** Use systems thinking when you are dealing with complex problems involving multiple interacting components, feedback loops, and systemic effects, such as environmental issues, organizational change, or public health crises. Choose lateral thinking when you need to generate creative solutions to specific problems within a system, or when you need to overcome mental blocks and think "outside the box" to find innovative approaches within a system.

In essence, these mental models are complementary rather than mutually exclusive. You can often use them in conjunction. For example, you might use systems thinking to understand the complex context of a problem, and then use lateral thinking to generate creative solutions within that system. First principles thinking can be used to validate the fundamental assumptions underlying solutions generated through lateral thinking. Understanding the nuances of each model allows you to select the most appropriate tool or combination of tools for tackling different types of challenges.

## 6. Critical Thinking: Navigating the Pitfalls of Lateral Thought

While lateral thinking is a powerful tool for creativity and innovation, it's essential to approach it with critical thinking and be aware of its limitations and potential drawbacks.  Like any mental model, it has its boundaries and can be misused or misunderstood.

**Limitations and Drawbacks:**

* **Lack of Structure in Idea Generation:**  While the techniques of provocation and random entry are designed to stimulate creativity, they can sometimes feel unstructured and lead to ideas that are too far-fetched or impractical. Without sufficient vertical thinking to evaluate and refine these ideas, lateral thinking alone can result in a collection of interesting but ultimately unusable concepts.
* **Time and Resource Intensive:**  Effective lateral thinking often requires dedicated time and resources. Brainstorming sessions, idea generation exercises, and exploring multiple perspectives can be time-consuming, especially when dealing with complex problems. In situations where quick, decisive action is needed, relying solely on lateral thinking might not be the most efficient approach.
* **Potential for "Idea Overload":** Lateral thinking is designed to generate a large volume of ideas. However, without a robust filtering and evaluation process, this can lead to "idea overload," where you have too many options and struggle to prioritize and select the most promising ones.
* **Resistance to Unconventional Ideas:** In some organizational cultures or social contexts, there may be resistance to unconventional or "out-of-the-box" ideas generated through lateral thinking.  People may be more comfortable with familiar solutions and may dismiss lateral thinking approaches as impractical or unrealistic.
* **Not a Substitute for Expertise:** Lateral thinking is a valuable supplement to domain expertise, but it's not a substitute for it.  Generating creative ideas is important, but those ideas still need to be grounded in relevant knowledge and expertise to be effectively implemented.  Lateral thinking can help you find new angles, but you still need vertical thinking and domain knowledge to develop and execute those ideas successfully.

**Potential Misuse Cases:**

* **Using Provocation for Shock Value Only:** Provocation should be used to stimulate new thinking, not just to be deliberately offensive or disruptive for its own sake. Misusing provocation can alienate people and hinder productive idea generation.
* **Ignoring Practical Constraints:**  Lateral thinking should not be used to generate ideas that are completely detached from reality or ignore practical constraints like budget, time, or feasibility. Creative solutions still need to be implementable within real-world limitations.
* **Over-reliance on Lateral Thinking:**  It's crucial to remember that lateral thinking is most effective when used in conjunction with vertical thinking. Over-relying on lateral thinking without sufficient analysis, evaluation, and logical follow-through can lead to impractical or poorly conceived solutions.

**Avoiding Common Misconceptions:**

* **Lateral Thinking is Not Just Brainstorming:** While brainstorming can be a part of lateral thinking, lateral thinking is a more structured and deliberate approach that includes specific techniques like provocation and random entry, going beyond simple idea generation.
* **Lateral Thinking is Not Always "Better" than Vertical Thinking:**  Lateral thinking and vertical thinking are complementary, not competitive. Vertical thinking is essential for analysis, logic, and execution. Lateral thinking is valuable for creativity and idea generation.  Effective problem-solving often requires a balance of both.
* **Lateral Thinking is Not Just for "Creative Types":** Lateral thinking is a skill that can be learned and practiced by anyone, regardless of their perceived "creativity." It's a systematic approach to thinking differently, not an innate talent.

To mitigate these limitations and avoid misuse, it's crucial to use lateral thinking thoughtfully and strategically.  Combine it with strong vertical thinking skills for evaluation and implementation.  Be mindful of the context and culture in which you are applying lateral thinking, and ensure that idea generation is followed by a robust process of analysis, refinement, and practical execution.  By understanding both the strengths and limitations of lateral thinking, you can harness its power effectively while avoiding potential pitfalls.

## 7. Practical Guide: Embracing Sideways Thinking in Your Daily Life

Ready to start applying lateral thinking? Here's a step-by-step guide to get you started, along with practical tips and a simple exercise.

**Step-by-Step Operational Guide:**

1. **Define the Problem Clearly:**  Start by clearly articulating the problem you want to solve.  What is the challenge you are facing? What are you trying to achieve? A well-defined problem is the foundation for effective lateral thinking.

2. **Challenge Assumptions:** Identify the dominant ideas and assumptions surrounding the problem. What are you taking for granted? What are the conventional approaches?  Actively question these assumptions.  Ask "Why?" repeatedly to dig deeper into the underlying assumptions.

3. **Use Provocation Techniques:** Introduce deliberate provocations to disrupt your usual thought patterns. Try using random words, illogical statements, or even absurd questions related to the problem.  Don't judge the provocations initially; simply let them stimulate your thinking. Examples of provocations:
    * "Reverse the problem." (Instead of "How to increase sales?" ask "How to decrease sales?")
    * "Distort the problem." (Exaggerate a key element of the problem to an extreme.)
    * "Wishful thinking." (Imagine an ideal, unrealistic solution, and then work backward to make it more practical.)

4. **Employ Random Entry:**  Introduce a random element into your thinking.  Open a dictionary to a random page, look at a random object in your surroundings, or use a random word generator online.  Try to make connections between this random element and your problem.  How might this random word or object relate to the challenge you're facing?

5. **Generate Alternatives and Explore Perspectives:**  Actively seek out multiple perspectives on the problem.  Imagine how someone with a different background, expertise, or viewpoint might see the situation.  Brainstorm as many alternative solutions as possible, without initially judging their feasibility.  Quantity over quality at this stage.

6. **Evaluate and Refine Ideas (Vertical Thinking Step):**  Once you have generated a range of ideas through lateral thinking techniques, switch to vertical thinking to evaluate and refine them.  Assess the practicality, feasibility, and potential impact of each idea.  Select the most promising ideas and develop them further.

7. **Iterate and Experiment:** Lateral thinking is often an iterative process.  Don't be discouraged if your first attempts don't yield immediate breakthroughs.  Keep experimenting with different techniques, refine your approach, and be persistent.

**Practical Suggestions for Beginners:**

* **Start Small:** Begin by practicing lateral thinking with small, everyday problems.  For example, try to find a more creative route to work, or brainstorm unusual uses for everyday objects.
* **Practice Regularly:**  Like any skill, lateral thinking improves with practice.  Set aside a few minutes each day to engage in lateral thinking exercises or challenges.
* **Use Lateral Thinking Tools:** Explore and experiment with different lateral thinking tools and techniques, such as the concept fan, random word stimulation, and provocation techniques. Find the tools that work best for you.
* **Collaborate with Others:**  Brainstorm with others and encourage diverse perspectives.  Lateral thinking is often more effective in a group setting where different viewpoints can spark new ideas.
* **Be Patient and Persistent:**  Lateral thinking is not a magic bullet. It takes time and effort to develop your lateral thinking skills. Be patient with yourself, and don't give up if you don't see results immediately.

**Thinking Exercise: The "Unusual Uses" Worksheet**

**Objective:** To practice generating creative ideas using lateral thinking techniques.

**Instructions:**

1. **Choose an ordinary object:** Select a common household object (e.g., a paperclip, a brick, a spoon, a rubber band).

2. **Challenge the dominant idea:**  What is the usual purpose of this object?  Challenge that assumption.

3. **Brainstorm unusual uses:** For 5-10 minutes, brainstorm as many unusual and creative uses for the object as you can. Use lateral thinking techniques like:
    * **Provocation:** "What if this object was used for the opposite of its intended purpose?"
    * **Random Entry:**  Pick a random word and try to connect it to unusual uses for the object.
    * **Wishful Thinking:**  Imagine an impossible or fantastical use for the object and then try to make it more practical.

4. **Record your ideas:** Write down all the unusual uses you come up with, no matter how silly or impractical they may seem initially.

5. **Evaluate and refine:**  Review your list of unusual uses. Select 2-3 of the most interesting or potentially practical ideas and think about how they could be developed further.

**Example using a "Paperclip":**

* **Usual Use:** Holding papers together.
* **Unusual Uses (Brainstormed using lateral thinking):**
    *  Small screwdriver for eyeglasses
    *  Emergency SIM card ejector for phones
    *  Miniature sculpture material
    *  Jewelry component (earring hook)
    *  Lock pick (in movies!)
    *  Toothpick alternative
    *  Fish hook (survival situation)
    *  Bookmark
    *  Hairpin
    *  Reset button for electronics

This simple exercise helps you practice breaking free from conventional thinking and generating creative ideas through lateral thinking.  By regularly engaging in such exercises and applying the step-by-step guide, you can cultivate your lateral thinking skills and unlock your creative potential.
