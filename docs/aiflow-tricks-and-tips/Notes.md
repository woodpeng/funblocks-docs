# Maximizing Sticky Notes

Sticky Notes are one of the most versatile node types in the FunBlocks AIFlow environment. This guide will help you understand how to leverage them effectively in your workflows.

## What Are Sticky Notes?

Sticky Notes in AIFlow function as flexible text containers that bridge human editing and AI processing. They serve as:

- Editable clones of AI-generated content
- Quick capture tools for your thoughts and ideas
- Input containers for text from external sources

## Getting Started with Sticky Notes

You can easily add a Sticky Note to your workflow by selecting it from the tools panel on the left side of the interface. This allows you to capture ideas immediately without interrupting your creative flow.

## Key Features and Use Cases

### Content Processing

Like other nodes in AIFlow, Sticky Notes have access to the AI functionality menu. This means you can use the content within your note as input for various AI operations:

- Generate presentation slides from your notes
- Have the AI review and provide feedback on written content
- Transform rough ideas into polished articles

### Importing External Content

When you have large blocks of text from other sources that you want to process with AI, Sticky Notes provide an ideal landing spot. Simply paste your content into a Sticky Note, then use the AI menu to analyze, transform, or enhance it.

### Critical Thinking Enhancement

Sticky Notes excel as tools for developing deeper analytical skills:
- Record initial thoughts on a subject
- Ask the AI to help with reflection exercises
- Identify contradictions or biases in your thinking
- Explore alternative perspectives on your ideas

### Knowledge Exploration

The exploration space feature allows you to use your notes as starting points for discovering related topics and questions, expanding your understanding in any direction.

## Best Practices

- Use Sticky Notes to preserve human-edited versions of AI content
- Clip key points from AI-generated content into Notes
- Keep notes concise and focused on single topics when possible
- Consider Sticky Notes as the "thinking space" in your AIFlow projects

By mastering Sticky Notes in FunBlocks AIFlow, you'll significantly enhance your ability to capture, process, and develop ideas with AI assistance.
