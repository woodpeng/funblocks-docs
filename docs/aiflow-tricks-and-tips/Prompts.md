# Creating Custom AI Applications

## Building Your Own AI Apps

FunBlocks AIFlow is an AI-native whiteboard application with powerful capabilities that complete the full cycle from generating creative ideas to organizing and producing finished work. Compared to using ChatGPT directly, AIFlow's AI assistant offers numerous "one-click" features that require no prompt writing from users, as AIFlow has integrated high-quality prompts that save you time and lower the barrier to entry.

### What if the built-in AI features don't meet your needs?

AIFlow provides direct prompting functionality for node content. In the AIFlow AI assistant menu, the input box serves as both a menu search box and a direct prompt input box. Simply type your prompt here, press Enter or click the "Confirm" button, and AIFlow will send your prompt along with the node content as context to the large language model for processing.

### Can you save frequently used prompts for one-click access?

Absolutely! AIFlow allows you to develop your own prompts as custom AI assistant menu items, eliminating the need to type the same prompts repeatedly.

#### How to create custom AI applications:

1. **Pin existing prompts**: When hovering over AI-generated nodes, several function buttons appear in the upper right corner (edit title, minimize node, delete node, etc.). For certain node types, you'll see a "Pin" icon button. Clicking this button saves the prompt that generated this node as a custom AI application, which will then appear in your AI Assistant menu for one-click access in the future.

2. **Create from scratch**: In the AIFlow application interface, navigate to the Settings page. Under "AI Apps/Prompts," you can easily create a new AI App that will also appear in your AI Assistant menu once saved.

### Cross-Platform Compatibility: Develop Once, Use Everywhere

**A major advantage** of developing custom AI Apps and Prompts in the FunBlocks ecosystem is their cross-platform compatibility. Any AI App or Prompt you create can be used across all FunBlocks products, including:

- AIFlow
- AI Writer
- AI Extension

This "develop once, use everywhere" approach maximizes your efficiency by ensuring that your custom tools are available no matter which FunBlocks product you're working with. Your carefully crafted prompts and applications become a personal productivity toolkit that follows you throughout the FunBlocks platform.

By creating your own custom AI applications, you can significantly streamline your workflow and maximize productivity across the entire FunBlocks ecosystem, tailoring the AI assistant to your specific needs and frequent tasks.
