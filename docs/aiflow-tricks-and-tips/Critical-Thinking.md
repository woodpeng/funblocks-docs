# Enhancing Critical Thinking Skills

In the AI era, knowledge and ideas are no longer scarce resources. What becomes increasingly crucial is our ability to evaluate whether AI-generated content is accurate or valuable. This is where critical thinking skills become essential.

## What is Critical Thinking?

Critical thinking involves carefully analyzing information, questioning assumptions, evaluating evidence, and forming reasoned judgments. It requires:

- Analytical reasoning
- Objective evaluation
- Identifying biases and logical fallacies
- Considering multiple perspectives
- Reflection and self-correction
