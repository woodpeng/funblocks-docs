# Leveraging Group Nodes

Group nodes are a powerful feature in FunBlocks AIFlow that can transform how you organize and process your ideas. Let's explore how to use them effectively and what benefits they bring to your workflow.

## What Happens When You Group Multiple Nodes?

When you group nodes in FunBlocks AIFlow, you unlock several advantages:

### Organization and Structure
First and foremost, grouping serves as an organizational tool. It transforms scattered nodes on your whiteboard into structured clusters based on your chosen principles or categories. This visual organization makes your workspace more navigable and your thinking more clear.

### Unified Management
Grouped nodes can be treated as a single entity, allowing you to move, resize, or perform other operations on the entire collection at once. This saves time and maintains the relationships between connected ideas.

### Enhanced AI Capabilities
Like individual nodes, group nodes have access to AI assistant menus. The key difference? The AI can use all content from child nodes within the group as context. This enables powerful applications such as generating:
- Comprehensive summaries
- Professional slideshows
- Detailed reports
- Structured documents

## Practical Applications of Group Nodes

### Brainstorming Sessions
During brainstorming, you often generate numerous ideas across different categories. With group nodes, you can:
1. Categorize related ideas into separate groups
2. Process each group individually with AI assistance
3. Generate tailored summaries or presentations for each category
4. Create comprehensive reports that maintain the logical structure of your thinking

### Ongoing Idea Management
For those who continuously capture thoughts and insights, group nodes offer a flexible organization system:
1. Classify random ideas into thematic groups as they emerge
2. Revisit any group when you're ready to develop those concepts further
3. Work with the AI assistant to explore specific idea clusters in depth
4. Transform loosely connected thoughts into cohesive projects

By mastering group nodes in FunBlocks AIFlow, you'll bring a new level of organization and AI-powered processing to your creative and analytical workflows.
