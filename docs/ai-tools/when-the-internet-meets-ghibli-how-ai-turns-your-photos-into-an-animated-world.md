# When the Internet Meets Ghibli: How AI Turns Your Photos into an Animated World – FunBlocks AI

Social media has recently been swept away by a wonderful style: your friends, the accounts you follow, and even some unexpected brands, their avatars and shared photos all seem to have taken on a dreamlike color, full of the gentleness and whimsy of “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro.” This trend, known as “Ghiblification,” is spreading across the internet at an astonishing rate.

**The Internet is Turning into Ghibli! (And You Can Too)**

Have you also noticed that recently, your social media feeds have been filled with a large number of charming, dreamlike images? They seem to have jumped directly out of the classic animated films of Studio Ghibli, whether it’s familiar scenes or users’ personal photos, all carrying that unique warmth and imagination that makes them instantly recognizable. The mysterious bathhouse in “Spirited Away,” the adorable Totoro in “My Neighbor Totoro”—these scenes that once only existed in our memories are now being presented to us in a brand new way 1.

This “Ghiblification” trend, as its name suggests, refers to transforming ordinary photos and even popular internet memes into the signature hand-drawn aesthetic of the renowned Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, especially the works of its key figure, Hayao Miyazaki 1. Whether it’s turning a pet cat into the Baron Humbert von Gikkingen from “The Cat Returns” or transforming your own backyard into the tranquil countryside of “My Neighbor Totoro,” this magical transformation has sparked huge discussions and sharing frenzies on major social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit 2.

So, how exactly is this “magic” that is sweeping the internet being achieved? The answer lies in a recent major leap in artificial intelligence technology.

**ChatGPT Unleashes Magic**

The driving force behind this visual style craze is the significant upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities released by OpenAI on March 25, 2025 1. One of the most notable features of this update is the ability to skillfully transform existing images uploaded by users into completely new artistic styles 1. Users quickly grasped the fun of this feature and began experimenting with turning their own photos, and even various images from the internet, into “Ghibli-style” creations, sharing the results on social media and thus igniting this phenomenal trend 2. Social media platforms, including Instagram and X (formerly Twitter), have been flooded with these Ghibli-style images 1.

Style transfer refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to learn the unique visual characteristics of an art style (such as the soft colors, delicate lines, and imaginative compositions in Ghibli animation) and apply them to a completely different image. Imagine uploading a photo of your pet and then selecting “Ghibli style.” The AI can instantly generate a cute character image that looks like it came straight out of a Miyazaki animation 1. This simple yet powerful function has greatly stimulated users’ creativity and desire to share.

On social media, we can see all kinds of “Ghiblified” examples. One popular example involved a user who took a photo of their cat and asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, resulting in an anime image resembling a character from Miyazaki’s films 6. Others have turned their family photos into warm animated scenes, as if they were from a scene in “Ponyo”; some have transformed ordinary landscape photos into fantastical “Castle in the Sky”-like vistas 1. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the trend, briefly changing his profile picture on X to a Studio Ghibli-style portrait of himself 1. This widespread adoption and sharing on platforms like Twitter quickly turned the trend into a viral phenomenon 1.

However, this carnival driven by free users did not last long. Due to overwhelming user demand and potential copyright issues, OpenAI subsequently temporarily restricted free users’ access to the image generation function 5. Nevertheless, this “Ghiblification” wave has fully demonstrated the huge potential of AI image generation technology and users’ love for this creative and fun interactive method.

The ease of use of this technology is a key factor in its rapid popularity. Users only need to simply upload an image, select a style, and they can get amazing results in a short time 2. This low barrier to entry allows both technology enthusiasts and ordinary users to easily participate in this creation, further accelerating its viral spread.

Of course, while AI art is booming, it is also accompanied by some discussions about copyright. OpenAI is also aware of this issue and has adopted a relatively cautious attitude, such as avoiding imitating the styles of living artists 1. This shows that while enjoying the convenience and fun brought by AI, we also need to pay attention to the ethical and legal issues it may bring.

**The Battle for AI Image Hegemony**

OpenAI’s decision to release such powerful image generation capabilities at this time may not be a coincidence. Just a short time before, on March 12, 2025, Google released its latest Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model 10. This model also has powerful image generation and editing capabilities and emphasizes its multimodal features, capable of accepting various inputs including text, images, and even audio, and generating corresponding text, images, and audio output in the future 10. It is worth mentioning that Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp also has the ability of “conversational image editing,” allowing users to gradually refine and modify the generated images through natural language dialogue 12.

These two tech giants in a short time successively released groundbreaking image generation functions, undoubtedly demonstrating the fierce competition in this direction in the field of artificial intelligence. OpenAI’s rapid response is likely stimulated by Google’s continuous progress in image generation 11.

Artificial intelligence technology is developing at an astonishing speed, and major companies are vying to launch more powerful and convenient AI tools. Whether it’s ChatGPT’s style transfer or Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp’s multimodal capabilities, they all indicate that in the future, AI will achieve deeper integration and application in various media such as images, text, and audio 11.

**[FunBlocks AI](https://www.funblocks.net/): Riding the Ghibli Wave**

In this wave of AI image generation, FunBlocks AI, with its keen insight and rapid action, integrated Google’s latest Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model into its AIFlow platform at the first opportunity 14. This means that FunBlocks AI users can immediately experience image generation and modification functions similar to, or even more powerful than, ChatGPT 14.

After AIFlow integrated Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp, users can generate exquisite images by simply describing them in text, or intelligently modify existing images 14. More impressively, FunBlocks AI has innovatively introduced a “smart Prompt generation” step 14. When a user submits an image generation request, AIFlow first uses a large language model (LLM) to deeply analyze the user’s intent, then automatically generates a professional and detailed image generation Prompt, and finally calls the Gemini model to generate the image 14.

This two-stage approach greatly improves the quality of image generation and the user experience 9. Many users often feel confused about how to write effective Prompts when using AI image generation tools. FunBlocks AI’s innovative solution cleverly solves this problem. Users only need to describe their ideas in simple language, and the AI can automatically complete complex Prompt engineering and generate amazing images 9. This undoubtedly greatly enhances the overall user experience of AIFlow, allowing users to easily visualize any idea and scene, thus becoming more productive 9.

FunBlocks AI’s emphasis on user experience is reflected in its optimization of the Prompt generation process 9. By introducing LLMs for Prompt analysis and optimization, FunBlocks AI lowers the barrier to entry for users, making it easy for even those without professional knowledge to create high-quality AI images 9. This user-centric design philosophy is an important factor for FunBlocks AI to stand out in the fierce market competition 9.

In addition, FunBlocks AI’s choice to develop based on powerful foundation models like Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp also reflects a wise strategy 14. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of existing advanced models, FunBlocks AI can focus more on optimizing the user interface and developing unique features, thereby providing users with better products and services 14.
