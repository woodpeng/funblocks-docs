        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Social media has recently been swept away by a wonderful style: your friends, the accounts you follow, and even some unexpected brands, their avatars and shared photos all seem to have taken on a dreamlike color, full of the gentleness and whimsy of “Spirited Away” and “My Neighbor Totoro.” This trend, known as “Ghiblification,” is spreading across the internet at an astonishing rate.</p>
<p><strong>The Internet is Turning into Ghibli! (And You Can Too)</strong></p>
<p>Have you also noticed that recently, your social media feeds have been filled with a large number of charming, dreamlike images? They seem to have jumped directly out of the classic animated films of Studio Ghibli, whether it’s familiar scenes or users’ personal photos, all carrying that unique warmth and imagination that makes them instantly recognizable. The mysterious bathhouse in “Spirited Away,” the adorable Totoro in “My Neighbor Totoro”—these scenes that once only existed in our memories are now being presented to us in a brand new way 1.</p>
<p>This “Ghiblification” trend, as its name suggests, refers to transforming ordinary photos and even popular internet memes into the signature hand-drawn aesthetic of the renowned Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, especially the works of its key figure, Hayao Miyazaki 1. Whether it’s turning a pet cat into the Baron Humbert von Gikkingen from “The Cat Returns” or transforming your own backyard into the tranquil countryside of “My Neighbor Totoro,” this magical transformation has sparked huge discussions and sharing frenzies on major social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit 2.</p>
<p>So, how exactly is this “magic” that is sweeping the internet being achieved? The answer lies in a recent major leap in artificial intelligence technology.</p>
<p><strong>ChatGPT Unleashes Magic</strong></p>
<p>The driving force behind this visual style craze is the significant upgrade to ChatGPT’s image generation capabilities released by OpenAI on March 25, 2025 1. One of the most notable features of this update is the ability to skillfully transform existing images uploaded by users into completely new artistic styles 1. Users quickly grasped the fun of this feature and began experimenting with turning their own photos, and even various images from the internet, into “Ghibli-style” creations, sharing the results on social media and thus igniting this phenomenal trend 2. Social media platforms, including Instagram and X (formerly Twitter), have been flooded with these Ghibli-style images 1.</p>
<p>Style transfer refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to learn the unique visual characteristics of an art style (such as the soft colors, delicate lines, and imaginative compositions in Ghibli animation) and apply them to a completely different image. Imagine uploading a photo of your pet and then selecting “Ghibli style.” The AI can instantly generate a cute character image that looks like it came straight out of a Miyazaki animation 1. This simple yet powerful function has greatly stimulated users’ creativity and desire to share.</p>
<p>On social media, we can see all kinds of “Ghiblified” examples. One popular example involved a user who took a photo of their cat and asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, resulting in an anime image resembling a character from Miyazaki’s films 6. Others have turned their family photos into warm animated scenes, as if they were from a scene in “Ponyo”; some have transformed ordinary landscape photos into fantastical “Castle in the Sky”-like vistas 1. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the trend, briefly changing his profile picture on X to a Studio Ghibli-style portrait of himself 1. This widespread adoption and sharing on platforms like Twitter quickly turned the trend into a viral phenomenon 1.</p>
<p>However, this carnival driven by free users did not last long. Due to overwhelming user demand and potential copyright issues, OpenAI subsequently temporarily restricted free users’ access to the image generation function 5. Nevertheless, this “Ghiblification” wave has fully demonstrated the huge potential of AI image generation technology and users’ love for this creative and fun interactive method.</p>
<p>The ease of use of this technology is a key factor in its rapid popularity. Users only need to simply upload an image, select a style, and they can get amazing results in a short time 2. This low barrier to entry allows both technology enthusiasts and ordinary users to easily participate in this creation, further accelerating its viral spread.</p>
<p>Of course, while AI art is booming, it is also accompanied by some discussions about copyright. OpenAI is also aware of this issue and has adopted a relatively cautious attitude, such as avoiding imitating the styles of living artists 1. This shows that while enjoying the convenience and fun brought by AI, we also need to pay attention to the ethical and legal issues it may bring.</p>
<p><strong>The Battle for AI Image Hegemony</strong></p>
<p>OpenAI’s decision to release such powerful image generation capabilities at this time may not be a coincidence. Just a short time before, on March 12, 2025, Google released its latest Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model 10. This model also has powerful image generation and editing capabilities and emphasizes its multimodal features, capable of accepting various inputs including text, images, and even audio, and generating corresponding text, images, and audio output in the future 10. It is worth mentioning that Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp also has the ability of “conversational image editing,” allowing users to gradually refine and modify the generated images through natural language dialogue 12.</p>
<p>These two tech giants in a short time successively released groundbreaking image generation functions, undoubtedly demonstrating the fierce competition in this direction in the field of artificial intelligence. OpenAI’s rapid response is likely stimulated by Google’s continuous progress in image generation 11.</p>
<p>Artificial intelligence technology is developing at an astonishing speed, and major companies are vying to launch more powerful and convenient AI tools. Whether it’s ChatGPT’s style transfer or Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp’s multimodal capabilities, they all indicate that in the future, AI will achieve deeper integration and application in various media such as images, text, and audio 11.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://www.funblocks.net/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FunBlocks AI</a>: Riding the Ghibli Wave</strong></p>
<p>In this wave of AI image generation, FunBlocks AI, with its keen insight and rapid action, integrated Google’s latest Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model into its AIFlow platform at the first opportunity 14. This means that FunBlocks AI users can immediately experience image generation and modification functions similar to, or even more powerful than, ChatGPT 14.</p>
<p>After AIFlow integrated Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp, users can generate exquisite images by simply describing them in text, or intelligently modify existing images 14. More impressively, FunBlocks AI has innovatively introduced a “smart Prompt generation” step 14. When a user submits an image generation request, AIFlow first uses a large language model (LLM) to deeply analyze the user’s intent, then automatically generates a professional and detailed image generation Prompt, and finally calls the Gemini model to generate the image 14.</p>
<p>This two-stage approach greatly improves the quality of image generation and the user experience 9. Many users often feel confused about how to write effective Prompts when using AI image generation tools. FunBlocks AI’s innovative solution cleverly solves this problem. Users only need to describe their ideas in simple language, and the AI can automatically complete complex Prompt engineering and generate amazing images 9. This undoubtedly greatly enhances the overall user experience of AIFlow, allowing users to easily visualize any idea and scene, thus becoming more productive 9.</p>
<p>FunBlocks AI’s emphasis on user experience is reflected in its optimization of the Prompt generation process 9. By introducing LLMs for Prompt analysis and optimization, FunBlocks AI lowers the barrier to entry for users, making it easy for even those without professional knowledge to create high-quality AI images 9. This user-centric design philosophy is an important factor for FunBlocks AI to stand out in the fierce market competition 9.</p>
<p>In addition, FunBlocks AI’s choice to develop based on powerful foundation models like Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp also reflects a wise strategy 14. By leveraging the powerful capabilities of existing advanced models, FunBlocks AI can focus more on optimizing the user interface and developing unique features, thereby providing users with better products and services 14.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Despite Google’s Gemini 2.0 Flash offering impressive image generation capabilities, many users—myself included—initially struggle to get optimal results. After extensive experimentation, I discovered a powerful workflow that dramatically improves output quality. Here’s how you can leverage this approach in your own projects.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-initial-challenge">The Initial Challenge<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/Unlocking-Gemini-2-0-Flash-Image-Generation-Potential#the-initial-challenge" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Initial Challenge的直接链接" title="The Initial Challenge的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>When I first started using Gemini 2.0 Flash’s image generation API, I followed the example prompts provided in the documentation. The results were underwhelming—lacking detail, coherence, and the visual appeal I was hoping for. Something was clearly missing in my approach.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-game-changing-discovery">The Game-Changing Discovery<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/Unlocking-Gemini-2-0-Flash-Image-Generation-Potential#the-game-changing-discovery" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Game-Changing Discovery的直接链接" title="The Game-Changing Discovery的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>After several attempts, I stumbled upon a remarkably effective solution: <strong>using Gemini itself to craft better image generation prompts</strong>.</p>
<p>Instead of directly writing image prompts myself, I began by asking Gemini to transform my rough descriptions into detailed, optimized prompts specifically designed for image generation. These AI-crafted prompts consistently produced significantly better images when fed back into the API.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>Original prompt: <em>“A flying pig”</em></p>
<p>Prompt generated by ChatGPT:</p>
<p><em>“Generate a highly detailed and realistic illustration of a pig with large, feathery wings soaring through the sky. The pig’s body should be well-defined with soft, textured fur, and its wings should resemble those of an eagle, with individual feathers clearly visible. The background features a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds, emphasizing the sense of height and motion. The lighting should be natural, with sunlight casting soft shadows on the pig’s body. The overall style should be semi-realistic with a touch of whimsy.”</em></p>
<p>This revealed an interesting insight: while Gemini excels at generating images, most users (including those with technical backgrounds) struggle to write the kind of detailed, structured prompts that yield the best results.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="implementing-the-solution-in-funblocks-aiflow">Implementing the Solution in FunBlocks AIFlow<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/Unlocking-Gemini-2-0-Flash-Image-Generation-Potential#implementing-the-solution-in-funblocks-aiflow" class="hash-link" aria-label="Implementing the Solution in FunBlocks AIFlow的直接链接" title="Implementing the Solution in FunBlocks AIFlow的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>Based on this discovery, I implemented a new feature in the image generation and editing tools of FunBlocks AIFlow. The workflow now follows these steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>The user provides a simple description of their desired image</li>
<li>An LLM analyzes this request and generates a professionally structured prompt</li>
<li>The system automatically configures image style parameters</li>
<li>The user simply reviews and clicks “confirm” to generate their image</li>
</ol>
<p>This two-stage approach has dramatically improved the quality of generated images, fully unlocking Gemini 2.0 Flash’s capabilities without requiring users to become prompt engineering experts.</p>

<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="why-this-works">Why This Works<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/Unlocking-Gemini-2-0-Flash-Image-Generation-Potential#why-this-works" class="hash-link" aria-label="Why This Works的直接链接" title="Why This Works的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>This approach succeeds because it addresses the fundamental gap between:</p>
<ul>
<li>What the image generation model is capable of producing</li>
<li>What typical users know how to request</li>
</ul>
<p>By inserting an intermediary step that translates user intent into optimized technical instructions, we remove a major friction point in the user experience while significantly enhancing output quality.</p>

<p>As image generation technology continues to advance, I believe this type of “prompt optimization layer” will become increasingly important. It allows models to reach their full potential while keeping the user experience simple and accessible.</p>
<p>For those working with Gemini or similar image generation models, I highly recommend experimenting with this two-stage approach. You might be surprised by how dramatically it improves your results.</p>
<p>Have you tried using LLMs to enhance your image generation workflows? I’d love to hear about your experiences in the comments!</p>]]></content>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We’re drowning in text. ChatGPT and other large language models have unlocked incredible potential, but the primary mode of interaction remains a relentless stream of words. I believe there’s a better way – a more visual, structured, and ultimately more intuitive approach to harnessing the power of AI.</p>
<p>That’s why we built FunBlocks AI Tools, a project focused on transforming AI conversations into visual thinking tools.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-problem-with-walls-of-text">The Problem with Walls of Text<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/beyond-text-a-visual-revolution-in-ai-interaction#the-problem-with-walls-of-text" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Problem with Walls of Text的直接链接" title="The Problem with Walls of Text的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>Current AI tools, while powerful, suffer from two fundamental issues:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Information Overload:</strong> Text-heavy interfaces can be overwhelming and inefficient for processing information. We spend too much time sifting through words, struggling to extract the core insights.</li>
<li><strong>Linearity Limits:</strong> Linear conversation flows limit users’ perspectives, creativity, and potential exploration paths. We’re stuck following a predefined track instead of freely exploring the landscape of ideas.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-funblocks-solution-visual-first-ai">The FunBlocks Solution: Visual-First AI<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/beyond-text-a-visual-revolution-in-ai-interaction#the-funblocks-solution-visual-first-ai" class="hash-link" aria-label="The FunBlocks Solution: Visual-First AI的直接链接" title="The FunBlocks Solution: Visual-First AI的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>To address these challenges, I initially developed <a href="https://funblocks.net/aiflow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FunBlocks AIFlow</a> – a solution that combines AI-powered whiteboarding with mind mapping. This approach replaces traditional text-based AI interactions with a more visual, structured way of thinking and exploring ideas. Imagine brainstorming sessions facilitated by AI, visualized in real-time on a digital whiteboard.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Image 1" src="https://funblocks.net/zh/assets/images/aiflow_benefits-b56c2ffe5ffd4c975a75418db5d19799.png" width="2118" height="1298" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>AIFlow’s flexibility allows it to handle a wide range of use cases. However, I discovered that this very flexibility could be daunting for new users. The blank canvas of possibilities, while powerful, could feel overwhelming.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="funblocks-ai-tools-focused-entry-points">FunBlocks AI Tools: Focused Entry Points<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/beyond-text-a-visual-revolution-in-ai-interaction#funblocks-ai-tools-focused-entry-points" class="hash-link" aria-label="FunBlocks AI Tools: Focused Entry Points的直接链接" title="FunBlocks AI Tools: Focused Entry Points的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>That’s why I created FunBlocks AI Tools as focused entry points into the AIFlow ecosystem. Each tool is purpose-built for specific use cases while maintaining the visual-first approach that makes AIFlow powerful. These tools generate:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mind Maps:</strong> Visualize ideas and connections in a clear, hierarchical structure.</li>
<li><strong>Infographics:</strong> Transform complex data into engaging and easily digestible visuals.</li>
<li><strong>Presentations:</strong> Create compelling presentations with AI-generated content and layouts.</li>
</ul>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Image 2" src="https://funblocks.net/zh/assets/images/Screenshot-2025-01-29-at-10.39.03-AM-0fad2dbfffeca2ce673461624e8229c6.png" width="2626" height="1766" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>Think of them as “gateway experiences” to the main AIFlow platform. They allow users to:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Start with simple, focused use cases:</strong> No more staring at a blank screen.</li>
<li><strong>Experience the power of visual AI interactions through one-click generation:</strong> See the AI’s capabilities in action immediately.</li>
<li><strong>Naturally progress to more advanced explorations in AIFlow:</strong> As users become comfortable with the visual thinking approach, they can unlock the full potential of the platform.</li>
</ul>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-vision-visual-thinking-for-everyone">The Vision: Visual Thinking for Everyone<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/beyond-text-a-visual-revolution-in-ai-interaction#the-vision-visual-thinking-for-everyone" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Vision: Visual Thinking for Everyone的直接链接" title="The Vision: Visual Thinking for Everyone的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>My vision is to make visual thinking accessible to everyone. I believe that by breaking free from the limitations of linear, text-based AI conversations, we can unlock new levels of creativity, productivity, and understanding.</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="looking-for-your-feedback">Looking for Your Feedback<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/beyond-text-a-visual-revolution-in-ai-interaction#looking-for-your-feedback" class="hash-link" aria-label="Looking for Your Feedback的直接链接" title="Looking for Your Feedback的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<p>I’d love to hear your thoughts on this approach. Specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li>Does this visual-first strategy resonate with you?</li>
<li>How do you feel about having focused tools as an entry point to a more comprehensive platform?</li>
<li>What specific use cases would you like to see implemented as standalone tools?</li>
<li>Do you agree that visual thinking tools could help break free from the limitations of linear AI conversations?</li>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A Real-World Marketing Case Study</em></p>
<p>In the age of AI, solo founders are achieving what once required entire teams. I recently launched FunBlocks AIFlow on Product Hunt, and when people learned I managed the entire process alone, their surprise was palpable. But here’s the thing – when you’re building AI tools to boost productivity, using them yourself isn’t just smart—it’s essential. Let me share how I leveraged FunBlocks AIFlow to orchestrate a successful Product Hunt launch, truly embodying the “eat your own dog food” philosophy.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Image 1" src="https://funblocks.net/zh/assets/images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-11-04-%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%885.00.05-1024x512-df398acff6b51fd0349daf870171f8ab.png" width="1024" height="512" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>FunBlocks AIFlow ranked #2 Education Product of the Week &amp; #4 Product of the Day on Product Hunt</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-power-of-ai-driven-content-creation">The Power of AI-Driven Content Creation<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/how-i-used-funblocks-ai-to-launch-successfully-on-product-hunt-a-real-world-marketing-case-study#the-power-of-ai-driven-content-creation" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Power of AI-Driven Content Creation的直接链接" title="The Power of AI-Driven Content Creation的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>The cornerstone of my Product Hunt launch strategy revolved around utilizing FunBlocks AIFlow’s web node feature. Here’s how I transformed <a href="https://funblocks.net/aiflow.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FunBlocks AIFlow product webpage</a> into a comprehensive launch campaign:</p>
<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="1-content-analysis-and-generation">1: Content Analysis and Generation<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/how-i-used-funblocks-ai-to-launch-successfully-on-product-hunt-a-real-world-marketing-case-study#1-content-analysis-and-generation" class="hash-link" aria-label="1: Content Analysis and Generation的直接链接" title="1: Content Analysis and Generation的直接链接">​</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>Imported product webpage into FunBlocks AIFlow’s whiteboard with URL link node</li>
<li>FunBlocks AI automatically fetched the page content and had a summarization of the content</li>
<li>With the Webpage node, prompted the built-in AI to craft compelling Product Hunt elements:<!-- -->
<ul>
<li>Product name optimization</li>
<li>Engaging tagline</li>
<li>Comprehensive description</li>
<li>Attention-grabbing first comment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>Product Hunt recommended to place a product introduction video on the launch page, so I leveraged FunBlocks AIFlow to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Generate a professional video script</li>
<li>Record screen captures following the AI-generated script</li>
<li>Create voiceovers using Azure TTS</li>
<li>Edit everything together in CapCut Pro</li>
</ol>
<p>While this video generation workflow worked perfectly for me, there’s always room for optimization based on your specific needs and preferences.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After a week of intense development using Cursor, I’m excited to share my journey and insights into the changing landscape of programming with AI assistance. As an early adopter of GitHub Copilot, I’ve now decisively switched to Cursor, and the experience has been transformative.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-shift-from-copilot-to-cursor">The Shift from Copilot to Cursor<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/i-developed-an-ai-infographic-generator-with-cursor-in-just-one-week#the-shift-from-copilot-to-cursor" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Shift from Copilot to Cursor的直接链接" title="The Shift from Copilot to Cursor的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>While Copilot impressed me with its ability to generate large code snippets, it ultimately felt like an efficient assistant rather than a game-changer. Cursor, however, has shifted my perspective entirely. As a programmer, I felt a profound change in my role – from being the primary code writer to something more akin to a product manager.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="a-new-workflow-with-cursor">A New Workflow with Cursor<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/i-developed-an-ai-infographic-generator-with-cursor-in-just-one-week#a-new-workflow-with-cursor" class="hash-link" aria-label="A New Workflow with Cursor的直接链接" title="A New Workflow with Cursor的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>To harness Cursor’s full potential, I adopted a new approach:</p>
<ol>
<li>Describe the product idea and let AI generate a PRD (Product Requirements Document).</li>
<li>Specify the tech stack and have AI create a project framework and directory structure.</li>
<li>Generate a basic, runnable codebase.</li>
<li>Iteratively implement feature modules with AI assistance.</li>
</ol>
<p>This process primarily utilized Cursor’s composer, with AI generating most of the functional code. However, there are important considerations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Break down features into smaller, clearly described modules.</li>
<li>Regularly commit code to manage potential AI-generated conflicts.</li>
<li>Provide context in prompts and ask AI to preserve existing functionality.</li>
</ul>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="the-future-of-programming">The Future of Programming<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/i-developed-an-ai-infographic-generator-with-cursor-in-just-one-week#the-future-of-programming" class="hash-link" aria-label="The Future of Programming的直接链接" title="The Future of Programming的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>While there are still challenges, the value and efficiency gains are undeniable. As programmers, we must reconsider our roles. With AI handling most coding tasks, we may need to embrace product management skills. It’s not far-fetched to imagine a future where product managers directly collaborate with AI to develop products.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-project-ai-infographic-generator">My Project: AI Infographic Generator<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/i-developed-an-ai-infographic-generator-with-cursor-in-just-one-week#my-project-ai-infographic-generator" class="hash-link" aria-label="My Project: AI Infographic Generator的直接链接" title="My Project: AI Infographic Generator的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>The result of this week-long collaboration with Cursor is an AI-powered tool for generating infographics and informative cards (FunBlocks AI Insights). Users can ask AI questions and receive answers in infographic form, provide text or URLs for content-based infographics, or choose from pre-designed AI card masters for unique, engaging information cards.</p>
<p>This isn’t just a toy project – it’s a real, working product. So, I invite you to give it a try and see the results of my collaboration with AI.</p>

        <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>A Start, Not an End</em></p>
<p>FunBlocks AIFlow’s Product Hunt launch ultimately landed us in 4th place for Product of the Day. I’m happy with the result, considering OpenAI O1 – a true industry sensation – received even more votes and rightfully earned its spot before AIFlow. There’s no shame in falling behind OpenAI.</p>
<p><img decoding="async" loading="lazy" alt="Image 1" src="https://funblocks.net/zh/assets/images/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-14-%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%883.52.23-1024x547-faea364433b1e6cc81aa35f28499546c.png" width="1024" height="547" class="img_ev3q"></p>
<p>FunBlocks AIFlow is Product of the day 4th.</p>

<p>OpenAI GPT-o1 new model is ranking ahead of FunBlocks AIFlow on launch day on Product Hunt.</p>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="my-gains">My Gains：<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/funblocks-aiflow-on-product-hunt-a-start-not-an-end#my-gains" class="hash-link" aria-label="My Gains：的直接链接" title="My Gains：的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>This launch experience has been incredibly valuable.</p>
<ol>
<li>Community: There are so many passionate users in this community who are eager to support each other. As a newcomer, I received a lot of helpful advice and encouragement – thank you again to everyone!</li>
<li>Preparation is Key: While Product Hunt provides a great platform for showcasing new products, simply submitting information isn’t enough. You need to actively engage by preparing compelling materials and proactively inviting hunters to try your product, so that they can provide in-depth reviews on launch day and sincerely cast their vote for your product. This takes time and effort, but it’s crucial for success.</li>
<li>Embrace the Unpredictable: Remember, you can’t control what other products launch on the same day. Ranking is partly luck. For example, who could have predicted OpenAI’s GPT4-o1 model launch at the same day? We might have snagged third place, but now we’re at fourth. It is what it is!</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="is-it-worth-the-effort">Is it worth the effort?<a href="https://funblocks.net/zh/blog/funblocks-aiflow-on-product-hunt-a-start-not-an-end#is-it-worth-the-effort" class="hash-link" aria-label="Is it worth the effort?的直接链接" title="Is it worth the effort?的直接链接">​</a></h2>
<p>Some have asked if it’s worth the effort to launch on Product Hunt. Considering the points above, I’d say it absolutely is. You’ll always need to prepare materials to introduce your product, whether you launch on Product Hunt or not. However, don’t overinvest, especially financially. Product Hunt is free, so aim for a free-of-charge approach. Remember, ranking on Product Hunt doesn’t guarantee success. True success comes from gaining traction with your target audience – and they’re likely not on Product Hunt.</p>
<p>So, is FunBlocks AIFlow a success? Not yet. Our Product Hunt launch is just the beginning, the start of our journey to be tested by users. We’re just getting started! Join us on this exciting path as we explore the future of AI and human collaboration!</p>

<p>Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm with their ability to generate human-quality text, translate languages, and answer questions. However, their traditional chat-based interfaces pose limitations. Conversations often become linear and unwieldy, making it challenging to explore complex ideas, track relationships between concepts, and maintain an effective overview. This is where the innovative concept of merging mind maps with LLMs emerges, with FunBlocks AI Flow leading the charge.</p>

<p>Traditional chat interfaces, while impressive, fall short in several ways:</p>
<p><strong>Linearity</strong>: Conversations flow in a single line, hindering the exploration of multiple facets of an idea.<br>
<strong>Limited Organization:</strong> It’s difficult to visually represent and track relationships between different concepts.<br>
<strong>Lack of Overview:</strong> Without a clear visual map, conversations can become disorganized and repetitive.</p>
<p>A flow map interface, like that of FunBlocks AI Flow, offers a compelling solution by:</p>
<p><strong>Visual Organization:</strong> Information is presented visually, facilitating better understanding and sparking new connections.<br>
<strong>Non-Linear Exploration:</strong> Users can freely explore concepts in a non-linear fashion, fostering creativity and effective problem-solving.<br>
<strong>Clear Overview:</strong> A bird’s-eye view of the conversation’s flow, key points, and connections is readily available.</p>
