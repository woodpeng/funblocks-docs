Main branches could represent key areas like "Target Audience," "Marketing Channels," "Campaign Messaging," "Budget," and "Timeline." Sub-branches under "Marketing Channels" might include "Social Media," "Email Marketing," "Content Marketing," "Paid Advertising," and "Public Relations," with further details branching out from each, such as specific social media platforms or content types.

Under "Language Skills - Speaking," sub-branches could include "Practice Partners," "Conversation Clubs," "Immersion Experiences."  Mapping out your goals in this way provides a clear roadmap, clarifies the steps needed, and helps prioritize tasks.

Sub-branches under "Causes" could include "Taxation without Representation," "Boston Tea Party," "Enlightenment Ideas." This visual representation helps students grasp the interconnectedness of historical events and concepts, making learning more engaging and effective.
