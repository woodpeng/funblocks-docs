His research focused on understanding how food reached the family table, identifying various "gates" through which food had to pass, such as purchasing decisions, storage, and preparation.

White analyzed the editor\'s daily decisions on which news stories from wire services to select and publish.

This evolution has brought new challenges and considerations to the Gatekeeper Model, prompting researchers and thinkers to adapt and refine the model to understand the dynamics of information control in the digital age.
