What is the Delphi Method in simple terms?"}),"\nThe Delphi Method is like a structured, anonymous conversation with a group of experts to get their best guesses about the future or to solve a complex problem.  It's done in rounds, where experts give their opinions, see what others think (anonymously), and then have a chance to adjust their own views.  The goal is to get a more reliable and well-rounded understanding than you would from just asking one person or having a regular group meeting."]}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(n.p,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"2. How many experts are needed for a Delphi study?"}),"\nTypically, a Delphi panel consists of 5 to 20 experts. The ideal number depends on the complexity of the topic and the resources available.
