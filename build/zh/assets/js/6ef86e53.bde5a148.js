For instance, techniques like reverse brainstorming (identifying problems instead of solutions) and brainwriting (silent idea generation followed by sharing) have emerged as valuable additions to the brainstorming toolkit.

Imagine a garden where delicate seedlings of ideas are just beginning to sprout.  If you immediately criticize or judge them, they might wither and die before they have a chance to blossom.

Because judgment, especially premature judgment, is the enemy of creativity.  When people fear criticism, they become hesitant to share unconventional or "out-of-the-box" ideas. They self-censor, sticking to safe and conventional thoughts, which often leads to incremental rather than breakthrough thinking.  By deferring judgment, you create psychological safety, encouraging participants to think freely and express themselves without fear of ridicule or negative feedback.
