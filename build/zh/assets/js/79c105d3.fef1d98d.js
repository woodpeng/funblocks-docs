Contrary to the prevailing psychoanalytic view that depression stemmed from unconscious conflicts, Beck observed that his depressed patients exhibited characteristic patterns of negative thinking. He noticed that they consistently interpreted situations in overly negative and self-critical ways, even when objective evidence contradicted these interpretations. Beck meticulously documented these recurring thought patterns, identifying what he termed "automatic thoughts" \u2013 negative, involuntary thoughts that spontaneously arise in response to situations. He further recognized that these automatic thoughts were often based on underlying dysfunctional beliefs or "schemas."  Through his clinical work and research, Beck systematically categorized these patterns of distorted thinking, laying the groundwork for the specific cognitive distortions we recognize today.

He argued that it wasn't events themselves that upset us, but rather our interpretations and beliefs about those events.  Ellis focused on identifying and challenging these irrational beliefs, which often manifested as rigid demands and unrealistic expectations. While Ellis used slightly different terminology, his \"irrational beliefs\" overlapped significantly with Beck's cognitive distortions.

Researchers and clinicians have continued to identify and categorize various types of distortions, providing a more detailed and comprehensive map of common thinking errors.  Furthermore, the application of cognitive distortion principles has extended beyond clinical settings, finding relevance in areas like education, business, personal development, and even technology design, as we increasingly recognize the pervasive influence of our thinking patterns on all aspects of our lives.
