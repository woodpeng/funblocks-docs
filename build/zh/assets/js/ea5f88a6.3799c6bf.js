(And You Can Too)**\\n\\nHave you also noticed that recently, your social media feeds have been filled with a large number of charming, dreamlike images? They seem to have jumped directly out of the classic animated films of Studio Ghibli, whether it\u2019s familiar scenes or users\u2019 personal photos, all carrying that unique warmth and imagination that makes them instantly recognizable. The mysterious bathhouse in \u201cSpirited Away,\u201d the adorable Totoro in \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro\u201d\u2014these scenes that once only existed in our memories are now being presented to us in a brand new way 1.\\n\\nThis \u201cGhiblification\u201d trend, as its name suggests, refers to transforming ordinary photos and even popular internet memes into the signature hand-drawn aesthetic of the renowned Japanese animation studio, Studio Ghibli, especially the works of its key figure, Hayao Miyazaki 1. Whether it\u2019s turning a pet cat into the Baron Humbert von Gikkingen from \u201cThe Cat Returns\u201d or transforming your own backyard into the tranquil countryside of \u201cMy Neighbor Totoro,\u201d this magical transformation has sparked huge discussions and sharing frenzies on major social media platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, and Reddit 2.\\n\\nSo, how exactly is this \u201cmagic\u201d that is sweeping the internet being achieved? The answer lies in a recent major leap in artificial intelligence technology.\\n\\n**ChatGPT Unleashes Magic**\\n\\nThe driving force behind this visual style craze is the significant upgrade to ChatGPT\u2019s image generation capabilities released by OpenAI on March 25, 2025 1. One of the most notable features of this update is the ability to skillfully transform existing images uploaded by users into completely new artistic styles 1. Users quickly grasped the fun of this feature and began experimenting with turning their own photos, and even various images from the internet, into \u201cGhibli-style\u201d creations, sharing the results on social media and thus igniting this phenomenal trend 2. Social media platforms, including Instagram and X (formerly Twitter), have been flooded with these Ghibli-style images 1.\\n\\nStyle transfer refers to the ability of artificial intelligence to learn the unique visual characteristics of an art style (such as the soft colors, delicate lines, and imaginative compositions in Ghibli animation) and apply them to a completely different image. Imagine uploading a photo of your pet and then selecting \u201cGhibli style.\u201d The AI can instantly generate a cute character image that looks like it came straight out of a Miyazaki animation 1. This simple yet powerful function has greatly stimulated users\u2019 creativity and desire to share.\\n\\nOn social media, we can see all kinds of \u201cGhiblified\u201d examples. One popular example involved a user who took a photo of their cat and asked ChatGPT to convert it to the Ghibli style, resulting in an anime image resembling a character from Miyazaki\u2019s films 6. Others have turned their family photos into warm animated scenes, as if they were from a scene in \u201cPonyo\u201d; some have transformed ordinary landscape photos into fantastical \u201cCastle in the Sky\u201d-like vistas 1. Even OpenAI CEO Sam Altman joined the trend, briefly changing his profile picture on X to a Studio Ghibli-style portrait of himself 1. This widespread adoption and sharing on platforms like Twitter quickly turned the trend into a viral phenomenon 1.\\n\\nHowever, this carnival driven by free users did not last long. Due to overwhelming user demand and potential copyright issues, OpenAI subsequently temporarily restricted free users\u2019 access to the image generation function 5. Nevertheless, this \u201cGhiblification\u201d wave has fully demonstrated the huge potential of AI image generation technology and users\u2019 love for this creative and fun interactive method.\\n\\nThe ease of use of this technology is a key factor in its rapid popularity. Users only need to simply upload an image, select a style, and they can get amazing results in a short time 2. This low barrier to entry allows both technology enthusiasts and ordinary users to easily participate in this creation, further accelerating its viral spread.\\n\\nOf course, while AI art is booming, it is also accompanied by some discussions about copyright. OpenAI is also aware of this issue and has adopted a relatively cautious attitude, such as avoiding imitating the styles of living artists 1. This shows that while enjoying the convenience and fun brought by AI, we also need to pay attention to the ethical and legal issues it may bring.\\n\\n**The Battle for AI Image Hegemony**\\n\\nOpenAI\u2019s decision to release such powerful image generation capabilities at this time may not be a coincidence. Just a short time before, on March 12, 2025, Google released its latest Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model 10. This model also has powerful image generation and editing capabilities and emphasizes its multimodal features, capable of accepting various inputs including text, images, and even audio, and generating corresponding text, images, and audio output in the future 10. It is worth mentioning that Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp also has the ability of \u201cconversational image editing,\u201d allowing users to gradually refine and modify the generated images through natural language dialogue 12.\\n\\nThese two tech giants in a short time successively released groundbreaking image generation functions, undoubtedly demonstrating the fierce competition in this direction in the field of artificial intelligence. OpenAI\u2019s rapid response is likely stimulated by Google\u2019s continuous progress in image generation 11.\\n\\nArtificial intelligence technology is developing at an astonishing speed, and major companies are vying to launch more powerful and convenient AI tools. Whether it\u2019s ChatGPT\u2019s style transfer or Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp\u2019s multimodal capabilities, they all indicate that in the future, AI will achieve deeper integration and application in various media such as images, text, and audio 11.\\n\\n**[FunBlocks AI](https://www.funblocks.net/): Riding the Ghibli Wave**\\n\\nIn this wave of AI image generation, FunBlocks AI, with its keen insight and rapid action, integrated Google\u2019s latest Gemini 2.0 Flash Exp model into its AIFlow platform at the first opportunity 14.

After extensive experimentation, I discovered a powerful workflow that dramatically improves output quality. Here\u2019s how you can leverage this approach in your own projects.\\n\\nThe Initial Challenge\\n---------------------\\n\\nWhen I first started using Gemini 2.0 Flash\u2019s image generation API, I followed the example prompts provided in the documentation. The results were underwhelming\u2014lacking detail, coherence, and the visual appeal I was hoping for. Something was clearly missing in my approach.\\n\\nThe Game-Changing Discovery\\n---------------------------\\n\\nAfter several attempts, I stumbled upon a remarkably effective solution: **using Gemini itself to craft better image generation prompts**.\\n\\nInstead of directly writing image prompts myself, I began by asking Gemini to transform my rough descriptions into detailed, optimized prompts specifically designed for image generation. These AI-crafted prompts consistently produced significantly better images when fed back into the API.\\n\\nFor example:\\n\\nOriginal prompt: _\u201cA flying pig\u201d_\\n\\nPrompt generated by ChatGPT:\\n\\n_\u201cGenerate a highly detailed and realistic illustration of a pig with large, feathery wings soaring through the sky. The pig\u2019s body should be well-defined with soft, textured fur, and its wings should resemble those of an eagle, with individual feathers clearly visible. The background features a bright blue sky with fluffy white clouds, emphasizing the sense of height and motion. The lighting should be natural, with sunlight casting soft shadows on the pig\u2019s body. The overall style should be semi-realistic with a touch of whimsy.\u201d_\\n\\nThis revealed an interesting insight: while Gemini excels at generating images, most users (including those with technical backgrounds) struggle to write the kind of detailed, structured prompts that yield the best results.\\n\\nImplementing the Solution in FunBlocks AIFlow\\n---------------------------------------------\\n\\nBased on this discovery, I implemented a new feature in the image generation and editing tools of FunBlocks AIFlow. The workflow now follows these steps:\\n\\n1.  The user provides a simple description of their desired image\\n2.  An LLM analyzes this request and generates a professionally structured prompt\\n3.  The system automatically configures image style parameters\\n4.  The user simply reviews and clicks \u201cconfirm\u201d to generate their image\\n\\nThis two-stage approach has dramatically improved the quality of generated images, fully unlocking Gemini 2.0 Flash\u2019s capabilities without requiring users to become prompt engineering experts.\\n\\n![Image 1](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*sEWz-Et6i72TU8sYlsh7pw.png)\\n\\nAI image generation with FunBlocks AIFlow, powered by Gemini-2.0-flash-exp\\n\\n![Image 2](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:1400/format:webp/1*tqZK9_J8Ur6RBAK81-423A.png)\\n\\nAI image generation and editing with FunBlocks AIFlow, powered by Gemini-2.0-flash-exp\\n\\nWhy This Works\\n--------------\\n\\nThis approach succeeds because it addresses the fundamental gap between:\\n\\n*   What the image generation model is capable of producing\\n*   What typical users know how to request\\n\\nBy inserting an intermediary step that translates user intent into optimized technical instructions, we remove a major friction point in the user experience while significantly enhancing output quality.\\n\\nTry it out here:\\n\\n[https://funblocks.net](https://funblocks.net/)\\n\\nLooking Forward\\n---------------\\n\\nAs image generation technology continues to advance, I believe this type of \u201cprompt optimization layer\u201d will become increasingly important. It allows models to reach their full potential while keeping the user experience simple and accessible.\\n\\nFor those working with Gemini or similar image generation models, I highly recommend experimenting with this two-stage approach.

ChatGPT and other large language models have unlocked incredible potential, but the primary mode of interaction remains a relentless stream of words. I believe there\u2019s a better way \u2013 a more visual, structured, and ultimately more intuitive approach to harnessing the power of AI.\\n\\nThat\u2019s why we built FunBlocks AI Tools, a project focused on transforming AI conversations into visual thinking tools.\\n\\n### The Problem with Walls of Text\\n\\nCurrent AI tools, while powerful, suffer from two fundamental issues:\\n\\n*   **Information Overload:** Text-heavy interfaces can be overwhelming and inefficient for processing information. We spend too much time sifting through words, struggling to extract the core insights.\\n*   **Linearity Limits:** Linear conversation flows limit users\u2019 perspectives, creativity, and potential exploration paths. We\u2019re stuck following a predefined track instead of freely exploring the landscape of ideas.\\n\\n### The FunBlocks Solution: Visual-First AI\\n\\nTo address these challenges, I initially developed [FunBlocks AIFlow](https://funblocks.net/aiflow.html) \u2013 a solution that combines AI-powered whiteboarding with mind mapping. This approach replaces traditional text-based AI interactions with a more visual, structured way of thinking and exploring ideas. Imagine brainstorming sessions facilitated by AI, visualized in real-time on a digital whiteboard.\\n\\n![Image 1](/img/uploads/2025/01/aiflow_benefits.png)\\n\\nAIFlow\u2019s flexibility allows it to handle a wide range of use cases. However, I discovered that this very flexibility could be daunting for new users. The blank canvas of possibilities, while powerful, could feel overwhelming.\\n\\n### FunBlocks AI Tools: Focused Entry Points\\n\\nThat\u2019s why I created FunBlocks AI Tools as focused entry points into the AIFlow ecosystem. Each tool is purpose-built for specific use cases while maintaining the visual-first approach that makes AIFlow powerful. These tools generate:\\n\\n*   **Mind Maps:** Visualize ideas and connections in a clear, hierarchical structure.\\n*   **Infographics:** Transform complex data into engaging and easily digestible visuals.\\n*   **Presentations:** Create compelling presentations with AI-generated content and layouts.\\n\\n![Image 2](/img/uploads/2025/01/Screenshot-2025-01-29-at-10.39.03-AM.png)\\n\\nThink of them as \u201cgateway experiences\u201d to the main AIFlow platform. They allow users to:\\n\\n*   **Start with simple, focused use cases:** No more staring at a blank screen.\\n*   **Experience the power of visual AI interactions through one-click generation:** See the AI\u2019s capabilities in action immediately.\\n*   **Naturally progress to more advanced explorations in AIFlow:** As users become comfortable with the visual thinking approach, they can unlock the full potential of the platform.\\n\\n### The Vision: Visual Thinking for Everyone\\n\\nMy vision is to make visual thinking accessible to everyone. I believe that by breaking free from the limitations of linear, text-based AI conversations, we can unlock new levels of creativity, productivity, and understanding.\\n\\n### Looking for Your Feedback\\n\\nI\u2019d love to hear your thoughts on this approach. Specifically:\\n\\n*   Does this visual-first strategy resonate with you?\\n*   How do you feel about having focused tools as an entry point to a more comprehensive platform?\\n*   What specific use cases would you like to see implemented as standalone tools?\\n*   Do you agree that visual thinking tools could help break free from the limitations of linear AI conversations?\\n\\nCheck out FunBlocks AI Tools and AIFlow, and let me know what you think!\\n\\n*   [https://funblocks.net/aiflow.html](https://funblocks.net/aiflow.html)\\n*   [https://funblocks.net/aitools](https://funblocks.net/aitools)\\n\\nAI Tools\\n\\n*   **Mindmap**\\n    *   [AI Mindmap](https://funblocks.net/aitools/mindmap)\\n    *   [AI Brainstorming](https://funblocks.net/aitools/brainstorming)\\n    *   [AI MindKit](https://funblocks.net/aitools/mindkit)\\n    *   [AI Task Planner](https://funblocks.net/aitools/planner)\\n    *   [AI Youtube Summarizer](https://funblocks.net/aitools/youtube)\\n    *   [AI Reading Map](https://funblocks.net/aitools/reading)\\n    *   [AI CineMap](https://funblocks.net/aitools/movie)\\n*   **Business Insights**\\n    *   [AI OKR Assistant](https://funblocks.net/aitools/okr)\\n    *   [AI Startup Mentor](https://funblocks.net/aitools/startupmentor)\\n    *   [AI Business Model Analyzer](https://funblocks.net/aitools/businessmodel)\\n*   **Critical Thinking**\\n    *   [AI Critical Thinking Coach](https://funblocks.net/aitools/critical-thinking)\\n    *   [AI Reflection](https://funblocks.net/aitools/reflection)\\n    *   [AI Decision Analyzer](https://funblocks.net/aitools/decision)\\n*   **Psychological Insights**\\n    *   [AI Counselor](https://funblocks.net/aitools/counselor)\\n    *   [AI DreamLens](https://funblocks.net/aitools/dreamlens)\\n    *   [AI Horoscope](https://funblocks.net/aitools/horoscope)\\n*   **Image Insights**\\n    *   [AI Art Insight](https://funblocks.net/aitools/art)\\n    *   [AI Photo Coach](https://funblocks.net/aitools/photo)\\n*   **Infographics**\\n    *   [AI Graphics](https://funblocks.net/aitools/graphics)\\n    *   [AI Infographic Generator](https://funblocks.net/aitools/infographic)\\n*   **Slides**\\n    *   [AI PPT/Slides](https://funblocks.net/aitools/slides)\\n    *   [AI SlideGenius](https://funblocks.net/aitools/one-page-slide)\\n*   **Others**\\n    *   [AI Poetic Lens](https://funblocks.net/aitools/poetic)"},{"id":"how-to-leverage-ai-for-marketing-success-funblocks-aiflow-explained","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/how-to-leverage-ai-for-marketing-success-funblocks-aiflow-explained","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-07-how-to-leverage-ai-for-marketing-success-funblocks-aiflow-explained.md","title":"How to Leverage AI for Marketing Success \u2013 FunBlocks AIFlow Explained","description":"truggling to create comprehensive marketing materials for your product launch?","date":"2024-11-07T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Idea","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/hello","description":"Ideas"},{"inline":false,"label":"Feature","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/feature","description":"Product feature"},{"inline":false,"label":"AIFlow","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/aiflow","description":"FunBlocks AIFlow"}],"readingTime":1.25,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Wood Peng","title":"SDE (Someone Do Everything) @ FunBlocks","url":"https://x.com/@woodpeng","page":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/authors/wood"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/woodpeng","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodpeng/"},"key":"Wood"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"how-to-leverage-ai-for-marketing-success-funblocks-aiflow-explained","title":"How to Leverage AI for Marketing Success \u2013 FunBlocks AIFlow Explained","authors":["Wood"],"tags":["ideas","feature","aiflow"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Beyond Text - A Visual Revolution in AI Interaction","permalink":"/zh/blog/beyond-text-a-visual-revolution-in-ai-interaction"},"nextItem":{"title":"How I Used FunBlocks AI to Launch Successfully on Product Hunt","permalink":"/zh/blog/how-i-used-funblocks-ai-to-launch-successfully-on-product-hunt-a-real-world-marketing-case-study"}},"content":"truggling to create comprehensive marketing materials for your product launch?\\n\\nIn this video, I\u2019ll show you how I used the FunBlocks AIFlow tool to generate a complete set of launch assets \u2013 all from just our product webpage!\\n\\nTraditionally, producing things like a captivating press release, engaging social posts, a compelling video script, and persuasive marketing copy would require a team of experts and days of work.

As an early adopter of GitHub Copilot, I\u2019ve now decisively switched to Cursor, and the experience has been transformative.\\n\\nThe Shift from Copilot to Cursor\\n--------------------------------\\n\\nWhile Copilot impressed me with its ability to generate large code snippets, it ultimately felt like an efficient assistant rather than a game-changer. Cursor, however, has shifted my perspective entirely. As a programmer, I felt a profound change in my role \u2013 from being the primary code writer to something more akin to a product manager.\\n\\nA New Workflow with Cursor\\n--------------------------\\n\\nTo harness Cursor\u2019s full potential, I adopted a new approach:\\n\\n1.  Describe the product idea and let AI generate a PRD (Product Requirements Document).\\n2.  Specify the tech stack and have AI create a project framework and directory structure.\\n3.  Generate a basic, runnable codebase.\\n4.  Iteratively implement feature modules with AI assistance.\\n\\nThis process primarily utilized Cursor\u2019s composer, with AI generating most of the functional code. However, there are important considerations:\\n\\n*   Break down features into smaller, clearly described modules.\\n*   Regularly commit code to manage potential AI-generated conflicts.\\n*   Provide context in prompts and ask AI to preserve existing functionality.\\n\\nThe Future of Programming\\n-------------------------\\n\\nWhile there are still challenges, the value and efficiency gains are undeniable. As programmers, we must reconsider our roles. With AI handling most coding tasks, we may need to embrace product management skills. It\u2019s not far-fetched to imagine a future where product managers directly collaborate with AI to develop products.\\n\\nMy Project: AI Infographic Generator\\n------------------------------------\\n\\nThe result of this week-long collaboration with Cursor is an AI-powered tool for generating infographics and informative cards (FunBlocks AI Insights). Users can ask AI questions and receive answers in infographic form, provide text or URLs for content-based infographics, or choose from pre-designed AI card masters for unique, engaging information cards.\\n\\nThis isn\u2019t just a toy project \u2013 it\u2019s a real, working product. So, I invite you to give it a try and see the results of my collaboration with AI.\\n\\n[FunBlocks AI Insights](https://funblocks.net/aitools/infographic)\\n\\n![Image 1](/img/uploads/2025/03/Screenshot-2025-03-03-at-11.28.36-AM.png)\\n\\nFunBlocks AI Insights: Chat with LLM and got infographics.\\n\\nConclusion\\n----------\\n\\nThis experience has highlighted the rapid evolution of AI in programming. While challenges remain, the potential for increased productivity and a shift in programmer roles is clear. As we adapt to working alongside AI, our focus may shift from writing code to guiding AI in product development \u2013 a change that could reshape the software industry as we know it."},{"id":"funblocks-aiflow-on-product-hunt-a-start-not-an-end","metadata":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/funblocks-aiflow-on-product-hunt-a-start-not-an-end","source":"@site/blog/2024-09-14-funblocks-aiflow-on-product-hunt-a-start-not-an-end.md","title":"FunBlocks AIFlow on Product Hunt","description":"A Start, Not an End","date":"2024-09-14T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Idea","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/hello","description":"Ideas"},{"inline":false,"label":"Feature","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/feature","description":"Product feature"},{"inline":false,"label":"AIFlow","permalink":"/zh/blog/tags/aiflow","description":"FunBlocks AIFlow"}],"readingTime":1.985,"hasTruncateMarker":false,"authors":[{"name":"Wood Peng","title":"SDE (Someone Do Everything) @ FunBlocks","url":"https://x.com/@woodpeng","page":{"permalink":"/zh/blog/authors/wood"},"socials":{"x":"https://x.com/woodpeng","linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/woodpeng/"},"key":"Wood"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"funblocks-aiflow-on-product-hunt-a-start-not-an-end","title":"FunBlocks AIFlow on Product Hunt","authors":["Wood"],"tags":["ideas","feature","aiflow"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"I Developed an AI Infographic Generator with Cursor in Just One Week","permalink":"/zh/blog/i-developed-an-ai-infographic-generator-with-cursor-in-just-one-week"},"nextItem":{"title":"How LLMs Power Dynamic UI for Seamless User Experience","permalink":"/zh/blog/beyond-chatgpt-how-llms-power-dynamic-ui-for-seamless-user-experience"}},"content":"*A Start, Not an End*\\n\\nFunBlocks AIFlow\u2019s Product Hunt launch ultimately landed us in 4th place for Product of the Day. I\u2019m happy with the result, considering OpenAI O1 \u2013 a true industry sensation \u2013 received even more votes and rightfully earned its spot before AIFlow. There\u2019s no shame in falling behind OpenAI.\\n\\n![Image 1](/img/uploads/2024/09/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-14-%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%883.52.23-1024x547.png)\\n\\nFunBlocks AIFlow is Product of the day 4th.\\n\\n![Image 2](/img/uploads/2024/09/%E6%88%AA%E5%B1%8F2024-09-14-%E4%B8%8B%E5%8D%883.19.29-1024x749.png)\\n\\nOpenAI GPT-o1 new model is ranking ahead of FunBlocks AIFlow on launch day on Product Hunt.\\n\\nMy Gains\uff1a\\n---------\\n\\nThis launch experience has been incredibly valuable.\\n\\n1.  Community: There are so many passionate users in this community who are eager to support each other. As a newcomer, I received a lot of helpful advice and encouragement \u2013 thank you again to everyone!\\n2.  Preparation is Key: While Product Hunt provides a great platform for showcasing new products, simply submitting information isn\u2019t enough. You need to actively engage by preparing compelling materials and proactively inviting hunters to try your product, so that they can provide in-depth reviews on launch day and sincerely cast their vote for your product. This takes time and effort, but it\u2019s crucial for success.\\n3.  Embrace the Unpredictable: Remember, you can\u2019t control what other products launch on the same day. Ranking is partly luck. For example, who could have predicted OpenAI\u2019s GPT4-o1 model launch at the same day? We might have snagged third place, but now we\u2019re at fourth. It is what it is!\\n\\nIs it worth the effort?\\n-----------------------\\n\\nSome have asked if it\u2019s worth the effort to launch on Product Hunt. Considering the points above, I\u2019d say it absolutely is. You\u2019ll always need to prepare materials to introduce your product, whether you launch on Product Hunt or not. However, don\u2019t overinvest, especially financially. Product Hunt is free, so aim for a free-of-charge approach. Remember, ranking on Product Hunt doesn\u2019t guarantee success.
