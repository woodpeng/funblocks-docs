While working as an advisor at the Bank of England in the 1970s, Goodhart observed a recurring phenomenon in monetary policy.

As policymakers focused intensely on hitting specific M1 targets, market participants and financial institutions started to adapt their behavior in ways that artificially inflated or deflated M1 without necessarily affecting the underlying inflationary pressures.  For instance, banks might create new types of accounts that technically fell outside the definition of M1, allowing them to circumvent the controls while still engaging in lending activities that could contribute to inflation."}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(i.p,{children:'This observation led Goodhart to formulate his now-famous law.
