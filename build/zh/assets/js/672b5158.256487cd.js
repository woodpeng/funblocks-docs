The fear of missing out is rooted in fundamental aspects of human nature: our social instincts, our desire for belonging, and our inherent curiosity about what we might be missing.  Throughout history, humans have been social creatures, attuned to the activities and experiences of their peers.  Tribal societies relied on shared experiences for cohesion and survival, and the fear of exclusion from important events was likely a significant social pressure.

In his article, McGinnis observed and named the pervasive anxiety among his fellow MBA students regarding social opportunities and career paths.  He noticed a culture where students felt compelled to attend every event, explore every internship, and network with everyone, driven by a fear of missing out on crucial experiences that could impact their future success. McGinnis described FOMO as a "social anxiety of missing out" and highlighted its connection to the overwhelming abundance of choices and opportunities, particularly in a high-pressure environment like business school.

This curated reality creates a fertile ground for social comparison and intensifies the perception that everyone else is leading a more exciting life.  Social media has democratized FOMO, extending its reach beyond the high-pressure environments McGinnis initially observed to encompass a much wider population.  Researchers have since explored the psychological underpinnings of FOMO, linking it to factors like low self-esteem, social anxiety, and unmet psychological needs.
