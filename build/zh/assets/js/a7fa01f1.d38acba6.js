In this letter, he advised a friend struggling with a decision to divide a sheet of paper into two columns, one for "Pros" and the other for "Cons."  He suggested listing all arguments for and against the decision over a few days, then objectively weighing them to arrive at a conclusion.

Furthermore, the modern Decision Matrix is often combined with other decision-making tools and methodologies, such as SWOT analysis, risk assessment, and sensitivity analysis, to provide a more comprehensive and robust decision-making process.

Scoring can be subjective or objective, depending on the nature of the criteria.  For criteria like "Price," you might use objective data (e.g., actual price).
