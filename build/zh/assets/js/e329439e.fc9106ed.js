The idea was to design products with a limited lifespan or perceived lifespan, encouraging consumers to repurchase goods more frequently. Think of lightbulbs designed to burn out after a certain number of hours or fashion trends that rapidly change, making last season\'s clothes seem outdated. While debated, figures like Bernard London, with his 1932 pamphlet "Ending the Depression Through Planned Obsolescence," and later industrial designer Brooks Stevens, who popularized the term in the 1950s, are often linked to its popularization, though the practice itself likely predates their articulation.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(n.p,{children:'However, "Planned Obsolescence" is largely viewed negatively due to its association with wastefulness, consumer manipulation, and environmental concerns.
