This analogy, applying the principles of software debugging to human thought, forms the bedrock of the mental model we\'re exploring.'}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(n.p,{children:"The concept of systematically analyzing and correcting errors is ancient, stretching back to philosophical traditions emphasizing logic and reason.
