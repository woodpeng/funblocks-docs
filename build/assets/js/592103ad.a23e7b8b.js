Define Goal           | Goal: Reinvent the common coffee mug to be significantly better.                   | I want to design a coffee mug that keeps coffee hotter for longer and is more comfortable to hold.        |\n| 2. Identify Constraints  | List all constraints you perceive about coffee mugs (e.g., material, shape, function) | Material is ceramic, must have a handle, cylindrical shape, holds about 12 oz, microwave safe, dishwasher safe, relatively inexpensive to produce. |\n| 3. Categorize Constraints | Categorize constraints as hard/soft, functional/non-functional.                 | Hard: Microwave safe, dishwasher safe. Soft: Ceramic material, cylindrical shape, handle, 12 oz size, inexpensive. Functional: Keeps coffee contained, allows drinking. Non-functional: Ceramic material, cylindrical shape, handle, aesthetic. |\n| 4. Challenge Assumptions | Choose 2-3 soft constraints. Challenge the assumptions behind them. Why are they constraints? | Soft Constraints Challenged: Ceramic Material: Why ceramic? Is it ",(0,s.jsx)(n.em,{children:"necessary"}),"?  Cylindrical Shape: Is cylindrical shape the ",(0,s.jsx)(n.em,{children:"best"})," for heat retention or ergonomics? Handle: Is a handle the only or ",(0,s.jsx)(n.em,{children:"best"})," way to hold a mug?"]})]})}function h(e={}){const{wrapper:n}={...(0,a.R)(),...e.components};return n?(0,s.jsx)(n,{...e,children:(0,s.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}}}]);
