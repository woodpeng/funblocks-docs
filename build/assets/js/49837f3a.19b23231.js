Participants were presented with the tempting aroma of freshly baked cookies and chocolate, but some were instructed to resist the treats and eat radishes instead, while others were allowed to indulge in the cookies.  Later, all participants were given a frustrating puzzle to solve.  The researchers found that those who had exerted self-control to resist the cookies (and ate radishes) gave up on the puzzle much faster than those who had been allowed to eat cookies.  This suggested that resisting temptation in one area depleted their capacity for self-control in a subsequent, unrelated task.'}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(i.p,{children:"While Baumeister's initial work focused on self-control in resisting temptations, the implications for decision-making were quickly recognized.  Making choices, even seemingly small ones, requires mental effort and self-regulation.

Decision fatigue primarily impacts System 2 thinking.  When we are mentally fatigued, our ability to engage in slow, deliberate, System 2 thinking diminishes, and we become more reliant on impulsive, System 1 thinking.  This shift towards System 1 thinking under decision fatigue explains why we are more prone to making irrational or impulsive choices when mentally drained.']}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(i.p,{children:'Over time, research on decision fatigue has expanded and evolved.

Some researchers suggest that decision fatigue might be less about a literal depletion of a resource and more about a shift in motivation or a change in cognitive strategies.
