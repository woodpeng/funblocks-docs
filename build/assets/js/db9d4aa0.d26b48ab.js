Conversely, when a project fails, hindsight bias can lead to unfairly blaming individuals or teams, making the failure seem like it was easily avoidable and the mistakes obvious in retrospect. This can stifle innovation and create a culture of blame rather than learning.  For example, after a successful product launch, a company might believe their marketing strategy was flawless, ignoring the possibility that a competitor\'s misstep or a change in consumer trends played a significant role.

During market downturns, the same investors might retrospectively claim they saw the crash coming, criticizing those who didn\'t sell in time.  This hindsight-distorted view can lead to overconfidence in future investment decisions and a failure to learn from past mistakes.

After seeing a student\'s exam score, a teacher might perceive the student\'s understanding as more predictable than it was, potentially leading to biased grading or feedback.  For example, a student who gets a good grade on a history test might convince themselves they were always confident about their knowledge, even if they felt uncertain while studying.
