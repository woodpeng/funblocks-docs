It's likely that the explicit naming and structured application of the \"Concept Fan\" emerged from practitioners seeking to simplify and operationalize de Bono's broader lateral thinking philosophy into a readily usable technique.  Over time, the model has been adopted and adapted across various disciplines, from business strategy and product development to education and personal development, becoming a valuable tool for anyone seeking to enhance their problem-solving and decision-making capabilities through structured creative exploration.
