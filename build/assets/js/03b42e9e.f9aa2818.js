Cultures that are highly consensus-driven or avoid conflict might be more prone to triviality, as discussing minor points can feel "safer" than engaging in potentially contentious debates about complex issues. Individuals who are detail-oriented, perfectionistic, or have a high need for control might also be more susceptible to getting bogged down in trivialities.  Conversely, cultures that value directness, efficiency, and clear prioritization might be less susceptible.'}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(i.hr,{}),"\n",(0,s.jsx)(i.p,{children:(0,s.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Resources for Deeper Understanding:"})}),"\n",(0,s.jsxs)(i.ul,{children:["\n",(0,s.jsxs)(i.li,{children:[(0,s.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"Book:"})," ",(0,s.jsx)(i.em,{children:"Parkinson's Law: The Pursuit of Progress"})," by C.
