A is true, therefore B is true"), and induction was about generalizing from observations to establish probable truths ("These swans are white, therefore all swans are white"). Abduction, in contrast, was about forming explanatory hypotheses ("The lawn is wet. It must have rained").

Later, in the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), abductive reasoning gained renewed interest as researchers sought to model human-like problem-solving and diagnostic capabilities in machines.
