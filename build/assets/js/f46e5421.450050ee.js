It's a way to measure how likely an event is to occur, expressed as a number between 0 and 1 (or as a percentage between 0% and 100%).  0 means it's impossible, 1 (or 100%) means it's certain, and values in between represent varying degrees of likelihood."}),"\n",(0,t.jsx)(i.p,{children:(0,t.jsx)(i.strong,{children:"2.

From financial investments to health choices, from weather forecasts to technological risks, probability helps us make sense of this uncertainty.
