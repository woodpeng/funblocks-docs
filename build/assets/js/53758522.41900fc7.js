For example, when people are asked, "How happy are people in California compared to people in the Midwest?", they often imagine Californians as significantly happier due to the sunny weather. However, when actually surveyed, the difference in reported life satisfaction between Californians and Midwesterners is surprisingly small.

The model hasn't fundamentally changed since its initial articulation, but its implications and applications have been broadened and deepened as researchers continue to uncover its pervasive influence on human judgment and decision-making.
