It's the fundamental economic reality that our wants and needs are unlimited, but the resources available to satisfy them are finite.  This scarcity can manifest in various forms: limited time, money, energy, attention, natural resources, or even opportunities.  Because resources are scarce, we cannot have everything we want.  This inherent limitation forces us to make choices, and every choice involves giving up something else.  Imagine you have a limited budget for groceries.

Compromise is about recognizing that perfection is often unattainable in a world of trade-offs and seeking solutions that are "good enough" or "optimal within constraints."
