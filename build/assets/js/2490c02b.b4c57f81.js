Barry M. Staw, a prominent organizational psychologist, is often credited as a key figure in formalizing and researching this phenomenon. In his seminal 1976 paper, "Knee-deep in the Big Muddy: A Study of Escalating Commitment to a Chosen Course of Action," Staw explored how individuals and organizations tend to escalate their commitment to a failing course of action, even in the face of negative information.

The term "Heuristic Escalation" emphasizes the role of heuristics, or mental shortcuts, in initiating and perpetuating this escalation process.

Furthermore, research has explored strategies for mitigating Heuristic Escalation, such as setting clear exit criteria, seeking external perspectives, and focusing on future outcomes rather than past investments.
