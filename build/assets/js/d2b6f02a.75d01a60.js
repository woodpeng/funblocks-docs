Information cascades can occur as subsequent reviewers are influenced by existing positive (or negative) reviews.  Emotional contagion can also play a role; if we see overwhelmingly positive sentiment, it can sway our own perception.  While reviews can be helpful, they are also susceptible to herd behavior.
