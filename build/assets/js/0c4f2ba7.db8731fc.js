Traditional notions of job security and long-term employment have shifted, leading to new forms of psychological contracts based on project-based work, flexible arrangements, and evolving career paths.  Furthermore, the model has expanded beyond the workplace to encompass various interpersonal and organizational relationships, including customer-brand interactions, patient-healthcare provider relationships, and even personal friendships and partnerships.  The core principle of unspoken expectations and reciprocal obligations, however, remains central to the model's enduring relevance and widespread applicability.
