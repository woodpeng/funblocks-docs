Textbooks on "Linear Control Systems," "Modern Control Systems," or "Nonlinear Control Systems" (depending on your math background) are good starting points. Online courses on platforms like Coursera, edX, and MIT OpenCourseware offer excellent resources. Books by Norbert Wiener, like "Cybernetics," are also foundational for understanding the broader philosophical context of control and communication.']}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.hr,{}),"\n",(0,i.jsx)(n.p,{children:(0,i.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Resource Suggestions for Advanced Readers:"})}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.li,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(n.strong,{children:"Books:"}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.ul,{children:["\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.li,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Cybernetics: Or Control and Communication in the Animal and the Machine"})," by Norbert Wiener"]}),"\n",(0,i.jsxs)(n.li,{children:[(0,i.jsx)(n.em,{children:"Feedback Systems: An Introduction for Scientists and Engineers"})," by Karl Johan \xc5str\xf6m and Richard M.
