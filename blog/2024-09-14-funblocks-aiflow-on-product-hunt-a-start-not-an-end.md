*A Start, Not an End*

FunBlocks AIFlow’s Product Hunt launch ultimately landed us in 4th place for Product of the Day. I’m happy with the result, considering OpenAI O1 – a true industry sensation – received even more votes and rightfully earned its spot before AIFlow. There’s no shame in falling behind OpenAI.

OpenAI GPT-o1 new model is ranking ahead of FunBlocks AIFlow on launch day on Product Hunt.

My Gains：
---------

This launch experience has been incredibly valuable.

1.  Community: There are so many passionate users in this community who are eager to support each other. As a newcomer, I received a lot of helpful advice and encouragement – thank you again to everyone!
2.  Preparation is Key: While Product Hunt provides a great platform for showcasing new products, simply submitting information isn’t enough. You need to actively engage by preparing compelling materials and proactively inviting hunters to try your product, so that they can provide in-depth reviews on launch day and sincerely cast their vote for your product. This takes time and effort, but it’s crucial for success.
3.  Embrace the Unpredictable: Remember, you can’t control what other products launch on the same day. Ranking is partly luck. For example, who could have predicted OpenAI’s GPT4-o1 model launch at the same day? We might have snagged third place, but now we’re at fourth. It is what it is!

Is it worth the effort?
-----------------------

Some have asked if it’s worth the effort to launch on Product Hunt. Considering the points above, I’d say it absolutely is. You’ll always need to prepare materials to introduce your product, whether you launch on Product Hunt or not. However, don’t overinvest, especially financially. Product Hunt is free, so aim for a free-of-charge approach. Remember, ranking on Product Hunt doesn’t guarantee success. True success comes from gaining traction with your target audience – and they’re likely not on Product Hunt.

So, is FunBlocks AIFlow a success? Not yet. Our Product Hunt launch is just the beginning, the start of our journey to be tested by users. We’re just getting started! Join us on this exciting path as we explore the future of AI and human collaboration!
