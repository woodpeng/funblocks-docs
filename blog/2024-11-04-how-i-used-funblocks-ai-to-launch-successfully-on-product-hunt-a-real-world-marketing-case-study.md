*A Real-World Marketing Case Study*

In the age of AI, solo founders are achieving what once required entire teams. I recently launched FunBlocks AIFlow on Product Hunt, and when people learned I managed the entire process alone, their surprise was palpable. But here’s the thing – when you’re building AI tools to boost productivity, using them yourself isn’t just smart—it’s essential. Let me share how I leveraged FunBlocks AIFlow to orchestrate a successful Product Hunt launch, truly embodying the “eat your own dog food” philosophy.

The Power of AI-Driven Content Creation
---------------------------------------

The cornerstone of my Product Hunt launch strategy revolved around utilizing FunBlocks AIFlow’s web node feature. Here’s how I transformed [FunBlocks AIFlow product webpage](https://funblocks.net/aiflow.html) into a comprehensive launch campaign:

### 1: Content Analysis and Generation

*   Imported product webpage into FunBlocks AIFlow’s whiteboard with URL link node
*   FunBlocks AI automatically fetched the page content and had a summarization of the content
*   With the Webpage node, prompted the built-in AI to craft compelling Product Hunt elements:
    *   Product name optimization
    *   Engaging tagline
    *   Comprehensive description
    *   Attention-grabbing first comment

### 2: Creating the Product Demo Video

Product Hunt recommended to place a product introduction video on the launch page, so I leveraged FunBlocks AIFlow to:

1.  Generate a professional video script
2.  Record screen captures following the AI-generated script
3.  Create voiceovers using Azure TTS
4.  Edit everything together in CapCut Pro

While this video generation workflow worked perfectly for me, there’s always room for optimization based on your specific needs and preferences.
