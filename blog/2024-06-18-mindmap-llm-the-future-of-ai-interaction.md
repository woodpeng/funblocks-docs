I. Introduction
---------------

Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT have taken the world by storm with their ability to generate human-quality text, translate languages, and answer questions. However, their traditional chat-based interfaces pose limitations. Conversations often become linear and unwieldy, making it challenging to explore complex ideas, track relationships between concepts, and maintain an effective overview. This is where the innovative concept of merging mind maps with LLMs emerges, with FunBlocks AI Flow leading the charge.

II. Why We Need a Flow Map Like Conversation with LLMs
------------------------------------------------------

Traditional chat interfaces, while impressive, fall short in several ways:

**Linearity**: Conversations flow in a single line, hindering the exploration of multiple facets of an idea.  
**Limited Organization:** It’s difficult to visually represent and track relationships between different concepts.  
**Lack of Overview:** Without a clear visual map, conversations can become disorganized and repetitive.

A flow map interface, like that of FunBlocks AI Flow, offers a compelling solution by:

**Visual Organization:** Information is presented visually, facilitating better understanding and sparking new connections.  
**Non-Linear Exploration:** Users can freely explore concepts in a non-linear fashion, fostering creativity and effective problem-solving.  
**Clear Overview:** A bird’s-eye view of the conversation’s flow, key points, and connections is readily available.

III. Introducing FunBlocks AI Flow: AI Meets Mind Mapping
